## The significance of Search and Rescue at Sea

The surface of the oceans is about 361.100.000 km².[^1] There are places
in the South Pacific ocean, where vessels are 2000 km away from the
nearest land.[^2] Having an accident so far away from land is
disastrous. There can be many reasons (e.g. broken rudder or mast, a
crack in the sail or even in the hull) but the consequences are often
severe. "Normal" accidents are unfortunate. Having a tire burst on the
highway is troublesome. However, at sea help may not arrive for 20
hours. That is without additional complications resulting from weather
or swell. Despite it is now the 21st Century, where high-tech radar
systems exist and swell and drift simulations calculate the position of
Men Over-Board, search and rescue missions can be a real challenge.

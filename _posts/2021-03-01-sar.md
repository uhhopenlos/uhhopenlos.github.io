## The significance of Search and Rescue at Sea

The surface of the oceans is about 361.100.000 km².[^1] There are places
in the South Pacific ocean, where vessels are 2000 km away from the
nearest land.[^2] Having an accident so far away from land is
disastrous. There can be many reasons (e.g. broken rudder or mast, a
crack in the sail or even in the hull) but the consequences are often
severe. "Normal" accidents are unfortunate. Having a tire burst on the
highway is troublesome. However, at sea help may not arrive for 20
hours. That is without additional complications resulting from weather
or swell. Despite it is now the 21st Century, where high-tech radar
systems exist and swell and drift simulations calculate the position of
Men Over-Board, search and rescue missions can be a real challenge.

When the sinking of the Titanic happened in 1912, operating the radio
was a day job.[^3] Therefore, when other ships warned the Titanic´s Crew
of an iceberg up ahead, the messages did not get through. The iceberg
eventually spotted, there was no protocol for how situations as such
should be handled. The radio operators did not know about the newest
alarm code standards.[^4] The evacuation took place without prior
training. The few existing lifeboats were not capable to transport
everyone from the vessel.[^5] In present time every coastal state is
obliged to establish a Rescue Coordination Centre which is often
connected to joint Rescue Coordination Centres.[^6] For a broader
context, the Global Maritime Distress and Safety system was
established,[^7] including various systems for better SAR-missions and
connection all around the world. Furthermore, there are technological
advanced methods to prevent fatalities at sea and to get help to the
people in need, e.g. unified radio control codes and systems.[^8]

This paper will analyse the present international legal framework
applicable to Search and Rescue (SAR) operations at sea. The first
chapter will briefly introduce the definition of distress. To be subject
to a rescue mission, there has to be need for help. This requires a ship
(or a human being) in distress.

The second chapter will introduce to the most important treaties and
their history. It will focus on the reforms each treaty entailed and
give an overview of the results. Doing so, the paper will present the
usual SAR procedure in a brief textual simulation of a mission.\
In the fourth chapter, the paper will dive deeper into the topic. The
goal is to lay out gaps in the set of rules which lead to controversies
regarding SAR which are important today. The paper will focus on the
situation people face after having been rescued. This will be done due
to the existence of considerable uncertainties of what the next steps in
bringing the rescued people to a definitive destination are,
particularly in relation to refugees. On board in safety, they can find
themselves in ambiguos situations. It is by no means clear that they
will be just brought to the nearest port. Interests of many parties play
into the proceeding of the situation. Such as the closest coastal State
may not want the rescued people to be disembarked onto its territory.
Several scholars have therefore tried to deduce a right to
disembarkation from the SAR framework and/or other international
instruments.

The paper will then end with a summary, again highlighting the most
important changes since the sinking of the Titanic and trying to
formulate an expectation on how SAR should - or is presumably going to -
evolve over the next couple of years in relation to the addressed
problems. The overall goal is to shed light upon the topic of SAR, the
applicable relevant rules and systems, what problems have been solved,
which problems remain and how as well as if they can be solved.

## Definitions of Distress Situations

SAR missions serve to save people in distress. Despite the lack of fixed
definitions originating from the legal framework itself, there have been
attempts to define a situation of distress.\
In the *Eleanor* case from 1809, Lord Stowell specified three
requirements for identifying a distress situation.[^9]\
First, it must be an urgent distress with a situation of grave
necessity. Second, although there is no actual physical necessity
needed, at least a moral necessity must be present. A damaged ship for
example, whose journey would be dangerous for the lives of the persons
on board would be called in distress.\
Thirdly, the distress must not be a self caused distress.[^10] According
to this approach, danger to economic values were not enough to determine
a situation of distress. This was acknowledged by the International Law
Commission (ILC) which stated that "threats to human live are at the
heart of the concept of distress".[^11]\
This view was echoed by the Irish High Court in the *M/V Toledo* case
from 1995.[^12] Here, the court took two separate steps: first it
distinguished between a situation where there is peril to the life of
the persons on board,- and a situation where the imminent danger only
concerns economic interests. In a second step the court ruled that: *if
safety of life is not a factor, then* (...) the States can *have proper
regard to their own interests* (...).\
One convention that has a narrower conception of a distress situation is
the International Convention on maritime search and rescue from 1979
(SAR 1979). Distress is defined in paragraph 1.3.13 SAR 1979 as "(A)
Situation wherein there is reasonable certainty that a person, a vessel
or other craft is threatened by grave and imminent danger and requires
immediate assistance".[^13]\*\* From a grammatical understanding
"distress" means "a state of danger or desperate need"[^14] It is worth
noting that the dictionary definition does not specify for what the
danger must be imminent. This is striking against the background that
among legal scholars, there is almost overall consensus, that a
situation where there is danger only for the cargo of the ship is
excluded from the definition of distress.[^15] However, this discrepancy
can be ascribed to the differences of legal and dictionary definitions.

A more controversial question is if danger to the life of a person
onboard is a compelling necessity for distress or if it is sufficient if
a person is in danger of severe health impairment.[^16] This is not
explicitly regulated in any framework. A more detailed analysis of this
matter would go beyond the scope of this paper.[^17] Nevertheless, it is
worth keeping in mind that the definitions for distress should require a
high-risk situation because distress situations may initiate high levels
of protection with significant impact on other States´ rights which
should not be applied easily.[^18] For instance, it is generally
recognised that foreign vessels in distress have a right of entry to a
foreign port and therefore to the territory of a coastal State,[^19]
irrespectively of the question if a right to disembarkment exists.[^20]

However, the applicability of framework which uses the term distress
depends on the definition of distress which applies to each convention.
The above-mentioned definitions are not conclusively enumerated.

## Relevant International Treaties Regulating SAR

The most important treaties for the evolution of SAR are going to be
presented in the following. The International Convention on Safety of
Life at Sea[^21] from 1914 (SOLAS 1914) was the first convention to
comprehensively treat the most important issues concerning SAR. The
SOLAS 1974[^22] can be called the next most important treaty because it
modernized important security measures for SAR. The SOLAS 1974 was a
fully revised version of the 1929[^23],1948[^24] and 1960 amendments. It
contains paramount precautionary provisions for the safety of life at
sea. For SAR missions, the SAR 1979[^25] can be named as the most
important treaty. It contains a very comprehensive set of rules and
recommendations to make SAR missions as effective as possible. This is
why this treaty and its amendments from 1998[^26] and 2004[^27] will be
in the focus of the following analysis.

### SOLAS 1914

Only two years after the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 some of the then
biggest naval forces corporately adopted a treaty to reform the safety
of merchant shipping at sea. The member States refer to this cause in
the preamble of the International Convention on Safety of Life at Sea
(SOLAS 1914) as following:\
*Having recognised the desirability of determining* (...) *certain
uniform rules with respect to the safety of life at sea,* (the States)
*have decided to conclude a convention* (...).[^28] The convention was
divided in two parts. First a provisional part, subdivided into eight
chapters and a second part to specify the set of rules from the first
part. The first and the second chapters were devoted to provisions on
how to give effect to the treaty and to which vessels the convention is
applicable. The third chapter seemed to be a direct response to the
Titanic's collision with an iceberg. Art. 6 I SOLAS 1914 provides the
legal basis of an ice patrol to "ensure the destruction of derelicts in
the north Atlantic Ocean" which the contracting parties established.
Furthermore, the ice patrol was made responsible for the study and
observation of the ice conditions in the North Atlantic ocean.\
Back then, the routes for the ships were picked by the steamship
companies. Those companies were now obliged to give public notice of
their routes. These were directly actionable measures to ensure the
safety of the transatlantic route which the Titanic took in 1912.

Art. 8 and 9 SOLAS 1914 introduced reporting requirements which obliged
the masters of the vessels to communicate all information they received
about dangerous derelicts to the vessels in vicinity and the concerned
authorities. Those authorities then had to bring the received
information to the attention of everyone concerned including other
administrations. This information had to be sent in a uniform
matter.[^29] These provisions promoted the coordination of the State
community for the purpose of safety at sea. Art. 10 SOLAS 1914 provided
a regulation for the informed vessels to alter their course and to
proceed with moderate speed. Albeit the impreciseness of the term
*moderate speed* it can be deduced, that informed vessels shall reduce
their velocity to proceed with caution. Art. 11 and 12 SOLAS 1914 embody
another step to create uniform legal rules by implementing provisions to
have satisfactory morse - signaling - equipment on board and how to use
them.\
Chapter four contained provisions for the construction of vessels. These
were amongst the paramount provisions to standardize safety of merchant
ships for all the signing parties. The fifth chapter was dedicated to
radiotelegraphy. In accordance with Art. 31 SOLAS 1914, all vessels, to
which the regulation applies, shall be equipped with radiotelegraphy
installations. This norm was complimented by provisions regulating the
use and the obligations that came from having such an installation. In
1914 it was not certain that every vessel was equipped with all the
technological equipment necessary for a safe voyage. The reason for this
was a lack of national, and especially international, obligation as well
as little motivation of the Shipowners themselves. Art. 34 SOLAS 1914
obliged the ship´s crew to maintain a continuous watch over the
installation. This obligation arrived either by the Flag State through
domestic law[^30] or for certain vessels directly from the convention
itself.[^31] In addition to this, every master of a ship, who received a
call for assistance from a vessel in distress was bound to proceed to
the assistance of the persons in distress by Art. 37 I SOLAS 1914. This
provision can be understood as one of the first written provisions
including the duty to assist distressed vessels.\
Chapter six provided regulations regarding life-saving appliances. Every
vessel from thereon was obliged to carry only as many persons on aboard
as there were lifeboats.[^32] This applied not only to newly constructed
boats, but also to existing ships.\
The seventh chapter provides rules for safety certifications of vessels,
while the eighth holds final provisions.

The SOLAS 1914 convention primarily provided the technical changes which
were considered necessary then. With the rules for the use of the
technical equipment the convention worked towards the unification of
international law of life at sea. Collisions with icebergs were reduced
by introducing the ice patrol and the information exchange between the
vessels.[^33]

### SOLAS 1974

The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea 1974 (SOLAS
1974) came with modernizations of the regulations from 1914.
Considerable changes were the implementation of State defined shipping
routes and provisions for the use and equipment of modernized
radiotelegraphy. Furthermore, SOLAS 1974 provided an innovative way of
implementing amendments to keep the convention as dynamic as possible.

The SOLAS 1974 was adopted in 1974 and entered into force in 1980. The
convention consists of 13 articles and an annex divided into 14
chapters. Especially,- because of the technical advances in the 20th
Century, there was room for regulations regarding new technology.

To keep up with modernizations of technical equipment the convention had
to be as dynamic as possible. Therefore, Art. 8 SOLAS 1974 provided a
way of "automatically" adapting specific parts.[^34] This provision was
important for the development of the convention as the objecting
governments had to take action to stop an amendment, not as usual, the
other way round. This has led to many amendments since then.[^35] The
convention is therefore often regarded to as the SOLAS 1974 "as
amended".

The first chapter provides definitions and general provisions, including
regulations for issuing safety certificates.[^36] Underlining the
States´ interests of multilateralism in the case of safety at sea,
chapter I regulation 19 SOLAS 1974 is especially worth mentioning, as it
stipulates a right for every contracting government to control every
ship (of other contracting Governments) in their ports in order to
verify whether such a certificate is on board. If it is not, the port
State can take the necessary measures to ensure that the vessel proceeds
only if the safety of the passengers or the crew is guaranteed. The
measures, the port State can take to handle the situation are not
limited by the convention. The officer carrying out the control is only
obliged to inform the consul of the Flag State of the vessel about the
taken measures and why such were deemed necessary. This provision amends
the authority of the port State by taking over duties from the Flag
State which is regularly[^37] the one responsible to do so. This is
outstanding because it stipulates an extra competency to the port State
deriving from international law additional to the territorial rights.

Chapter four contributes regulations regarding technical developments
for radiotelegraphy and radiotelephony. The paramount reform is the
implementation of the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS)
which is further shaped by the SAR 1979.[^38] The system consists of
technical and organizational requirements. Automatically activated
distress-signal transmitters as well as radar direction finders need to
be installed on the vessels.[^39] Particular parts of the GMDSS are
Satellite Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacons (EPIRBs) and
Search and Rescue transponders (SARTs).[^40] These devices are activated
manually or automatically, shall withstand severe conditions and shall
always be carried on the vessel and the lifeboats.[^41] Depending on the
type of vessel the ship has to be additionally equipped with VHF
radiotelephone, DSC or AIS transmitters[^42] and NAVTEX.[^43] These
installations are substantiated by various locating satellites.\
Additionally to the safety provisions there can be found links to
operational regulations of SAR in chapter five. Especially important is
regulation 10 as it states the obligation of every master of a ship to
proceed with all speed to the assistance of the persons in distress upon
receiving a distress signal. If this is, as the wording suggests, a
regulation directed straight to the master of the vessel is highly
controversial.[^44] This is of importance for the question of
subjectivity in international law as it seems, that the master of the
vessel is individually obligated by SOLAS 1974.[^45]

A further regulation which contributes noticeably to the SAR missions is
regulation 15 SOLAS 1974 which provides the groundwork for governmental
SAR organizations and maritime safety facilities. Thereby, each
Government has to undertake arrangements to ensure that persons in
distress around their coast are rescued. The propound measures should
include the establishment and operation of maritime safety arrangements
and should be adequate to locate and rescue persons in distress. These
regulations are precautionary as they prepare the region for future
distress situations. One could argue these provisions are only
applicable to the adjacent waters of the coastal State, thereby meaning
the maritime zones under at least functional sovereign rights.[^46] To
the background of an historical point of view this is not too
controversial. It will be seen,[^47] that the SAR 1979 convention
extended the State duty of operating SAR services to all parts of the
seas to organize and unify State efforts. The reason being different
possibilities and endaevours of different countries around the world.

Chapter VI to XIV provide other safety measures e.g. for specific
vessels and their cargo such as nuclear ships or bulk carriers. These
measures are an outcome of the technological advance, that was made
during the 20th century.

The SOLAS 1974 advanced the safety of merchant vessels to prevent
accidents in the first place. If a ship is sailing without a safety
certificate, the concerned member States can take measures for ensuring,
that the vessel only sails if safe voyage is guaranteed. Following the
technological advance, there are additional technical measures
introduced. The convention makes sure that a vessel in distress is not
only able to contact nearby ships, but also that the vessel can be
located by onshore organizations to send help.

### State of Search and Rescue after SOLAS 1974

Although the SOLAS 1974 provided the technical grounds for SAR, there
was still disparity in the common practice of SAR. Some States were
dedicated to provide well equipped and efficient SAR services. The Royal
National Lifeboat Institution for example was one of the first
institutions to provide SAR for the UK.[^48] In other parts of the
oceans, little help was to be anticipated for distressed people. There
was a lack of technical possibilities and even a lack of political will
on behalf of some coastal States. The so called boatpeople in the South
China Sea could barely rely on help of the bordering States. It was i.a.
for European rescue missions to support on site SAR services.[^49] The
SAR 1979 therefore aimed for unification by providing an international
SAR plan and urged the neighbouring-States to cooperate where necessary.

### SAR 1979

Because the SAR 1979 was amended several times, this part will refer to
the SAR 1979 as amended[^50] in 1998[^51] (SAR 1998) and 2004[^52] (SAR
2004). Especially the amendment from 1998 was of such size and
importance, that it would be fruitless for the study of SAR to look at
each amendment separately.\
The original treaty consisted of eight articles and an annex divided
into six chapters. The current annex is divided into five chapters.

Special interest shall be paid to Art. III SAR 1979, which provides the
convention with a dynamic instrument to keep the convention updated by
way of amendments. The regulation is comparable with Art. 8 SOLAS
1974.[^53] As in the SOLAS 1974 convention, if an amendment concerns
certain regulations, the amendment enters into force by a certain date
if no party objects.\
The first chapter, which was entirely renewed by the 1998 amendment,
contains the definition of the terms used in the annex.\
Chapter two[^54] inaugurates the organization and co-ordination of SAR
operations. By chapter 2 paragraph 2.1.1 SAR 1979, parties shall develop
SAR-services, either in cooperation with other States, with the
organization, or individually. SAR-services are defined as "distress
monitoring, communication, co-ordination and search and rescue
functions, including provision of medical advice, initial medical
assistance, or medical evacuation".[^55] These services are provided by
using public and private resources including co-operating aircraft,
vessels and other craft and installations. The responsibilities are
clear: the parties have to establish basic elements of SAR services.
Those can be described as:

1.  legal framework;[^56]

2.  assignment of a responsible authority;[^57]

3.  organisation of available resources;[^58]

4.  communication facilities;[^59]

5.  co-ordination and operational functions;[^60] and

6.  processes to improve the service including planning, domestic and
    international co-operative relationships and training.[^61]

These obligations do not exhaust in establishing SAR-services to the
adjacent coast but apply to the whole sea.[^62] Chapter 2 paragraph
2.1.3 SAR 1979 is of paramount importance for the evolution of SAR.
Parties to the convention shall establish SAR regions (SRR) within *each
sea area*. These regions shall be established by agreement among the
parties concerned.[^63] In these designated areas, the parties are
responsible for the SAR-services and by chapter 2 paragraph 2.1.9 SAR
1979 shall use SAR units and other available facilities for providing
these services. This provision takes a big step to the unification of
SAR services. It is not supposed to leave any "white dots".[^64] To
ensure this, the provision is complemented by appropriate national
procedures which shall be established by each party to develop,
coordinate and improve SAR services.[^65] These procedures shall include
planning, training and exercising SAR operations.

To meet the requirements of the SAR services, the parties shall
establish rescue Coordination centres[^66] (RCC) and sub-centers (RSC)
where appropriate.[^67] RCCs are defined by chapter 1 paragraphs 1.3.5
and 1.3.6 SAR 1979 as units, responsible for the efficient organization
of SAR services and for coordinating the SAR operations in the
designated sea areas. RSCs are units to complement the RCC where
necessary. These centers are part of the GMDSS, which the SOLAS 1974
introduced.[^68]

The third chapter is designated to administer the cooperation between
the signing parties. The predominant interest of the founders is made
clear in chapter 3 paragraph 3.1: *Parties shall coordinate their search
and rescue organizations and should (...) coordinate* with the SAR
services of the neighbouring States. Therefore, the concerned State
should authorize *immediate entry into (...) its territorial sea (...)
for the purpose of searching for the* people in distress.\
The State in question then remains responsible for the coordination of
the mission or hands over responsibility to another authority. Moreover,
the convention urges the parties to enter into agreements to decrease
the level of formalities needed for such an entry by chapter 3 paragraph
3.1.5 SAR 1979.\
Furthermore, the parties are obliged to ensure that the RCCs cooperate
with each other by providing other RCCs with vessels, personnel or
equipment.[^69] Also, the parties shall authorize the responsible
authorities to make operational plans and arrangements for SAR missions
with the corresponding authorities of other States. Additionally, the
parties shall *coordinate* that masters of vessels providing assistance
are released from their obligations as soon as possible, so they can
continue their voyage.[^70]

The intention of the writers of the convention are lucid in this
context. The organization of such a critical situation as distress at
sea is best dealt with by cooperating administrations. There shall be as
little hinderance as possible for the success of SAR missions. Because
people in distress do not take national borders into account while being
in distress, an efficient SAR mission must not do so either.

The most controversial evolution of the SAR framework was implemented in
2004. During the course of action of the *Tampa*[^71] incident in
Australia a question that evolved in the years before became practically
relevant. What happens after a person in distress is safely aboard the
rescuing vessel? The answer to this question was addressed in the SAR
2004 amendment. It states that rescued people are to be delivered to a
place of safety. However, taking into account that the SAR convention
does not define the term "place of safety", the newly introduced
regulation lacks legal clarity.[^72]

Chapter five contains complementary provisions for the GMDSS by
providing regulations for ship reporting systems. Against the
background, that for the technical provisions of safety of vessels the
SOLAS is the pertinent convention, chapter five focusses on the
cooperation of States regarding ship reporting systems. It recommends,
the reporting systems should be able to provide up to date information
on the movements of vessels. The goal is to reduce the time between the
distress signal and the successful rescue mission.\
The fourth chapter introduces the International Maritime Search and
Rescue Manual (IAMSAR).[^73] The IAMSAR provides guidelines for an
aligned operational approach to SAR services.\
The SAR 1979 is the first convention not to focus on the prevention of
distress at sea but on the way the reaction to a distress signal should
be operated. How a distress situation is dealt with is part of an
explanatory part in the following Paragraph.

#### Subjects to SAR and IAMSAR

The direct procedures considered for SAR in the IAMSAR are recommended
in the second volume. The third volume provides suggestions of actions
for masters of vessels on their way. It also provides suggestions
regarding the training standards of the crews. The second volume
provides an encyclopedic gathering of suggestions for the organizations
concerned. The provisions from the IAMSAR are thus not binding but are
sincere recommendations and recognized amongst seafarers.

#### The Procedure of Search and Rescue

The IAMSAR divides the procedures of SAR missions into five operational
stages.[^74] The stages are applied according to practicability. They
can coincide or be applied concurrently. It is not necessary to begin
with the first stage or to go through all stages. To give an impression
on how an SAR mission could be exercised all stages are presented in a
serial way.

Whenever a SAR organization (most commonly an RCC) receives knowledge of
a possible SAR situation, the Awareness stage is initiated.[^75] At this
stage all reports of the incident have to be evaluated to determine its
validity, the urgency of the situation and the extent of the SAR mission
required.[^76] The Initial Action stage represents the first stage of
response. At this stage two principles of SAR missions can be observed
which are cooperation and coordination. These principles entail
simplifying the mission´s proceeding by assigning someone responsible in
advance. This is reflected by chapter 3.5.2 lit. (a) IAMSAR II which
stipulates that the responsible organization should appoint a mission
co-ordinator at this stage. To designate the responsible coordinator the
IAMSAR holds a proceeding which should be followed. Normally, an RCC
which receives a distress alert will assume responsibility for that
incident. However, when the distress alert is received from outside the
designated region the RCC advises other units in the vicinity. It is
then to decide which organization is able to assist in the most
effective way.[^77] The responsible organization should then attempt to
gather more information about the vessel in question[^78] and request
nearby ships to keep a lookout for the vessel.[^79] The knowledge can be
received by various installations of the GMDSS.[^80] The vessel in
distress may send a distress signal manually or automatically via EPIRB.
Furthermore, if the RCC itself suspects a distress situation they can
self-reliantly initiate the necessary stages.

During the Planning stage, the SAR mission is planned comprehensively.
After receiving knowledge of a distress situation, the location of the
vessel in distress is the most crucial task. The uncertainty about the
location of the vessel can severely impair the success of the mission.
Therefore, IAMSAR holds an extensive catalogue of actions in store on
how to proceed with or without digital support.[^81] The procedure is
the following: from a fixed datum, the last known position (LKP) has to
be calculated. Notwithstanding the help of location service satellites
and the help of nearby vessels, the LKP can result in a search radiant
of five kilometers (about three nautical miles). From that point on, the
actual position has to be estimated. The planned route of the ship, the
sea and weather conditions, the swell and the drift from the currents
have to be taken into consideration. These factors can affect the
location drastically.

The following Operation stage encompasses all activities that involve
searching for the vessel and providing assistance.[^82] This includes
searching for the vessel using search patterns[^83] and providing the
gathered information to everyone concerned.[^84] Following this, the
survivors should be embarked to the saving vessel and should be provided
with supplies and medical attention.[^85]

At the Conclusion stage the vessel is not in distress anymore, the
survivors have been rescued or the responsible organization has
determined that further search would be to no avail because additional
search cannot effectively increase the chances of finding the distressed
persons.[^86] When the SAR mission is terminated, everyone concerned has
to be notified.[^87]

The SAR 1979 provides additional Emergency phases to assist in
determining the appropriate operating procedures,[^88] namely the
Uncertainty,- Alert,- and the Distress phase. These shall be applied
according to practicability and are then supplemented by the operating
procedures of the IAMSAR.[^89] The Uncertainty phase and the Alert
phase[^90] may be applied during the initial action stage. The Planning
stage often includes the Alert phase and the Distress phase.[^91]

## Right of Disembarkation

Albeit the comprehensive framework for the SAR missions there is a lack
of regulations regarding actions to take once the survivors are onboard.
The discussion of the scope of the right of disembarkation emerged with
the rise of maritime migration[^92] in the mid- 1970s and 80s. At the
time many of the so called "boat people" fled from Vietnam and from
other communist regimes on the Asian-oceanic continent. These people
tried to get to other countries by using cheap and often unsecure boats.
This is one of the reasons they often got in distress.\
At the same time, the oceans became more accessible for private
individuals and leisure yacht owners.[^93] Oppositely to the historic
seafarers which knew the perils of the sea and were greatly trained for
merchant shipping on the high seas,[^94] neither the refugees nor the
leisure yacht-owners are traditional beneficiaries of SAR services. The
first question to answer will be, if these individuals fall under the
SAR conventions at all.

### Personal applicability of the SAR framework

SAR missions are targeted at persons or vessels in distress. Through
requiring the masters of vessels to "render assistance to any person
found at sea" the wording of Art. 98 UNCLOS makes clear, that no
classification between rescues is permissible.[^95] Furthermore, Art. 11
of the Brussels Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules with
Respect to Assistance and Salvage at Sea (Convention on Salvage) from
1910 set rules to save everyone at sea regardless of whether they were
enemies.[^96] This view has been implicated into today´s most relevant
treaties as seen in chapter 2 paragraph 2.1.10 SAR 1979 which states
that the States shall ensure that assistance is provided to any person
regardless of the nationality, the status or the circumstances in which
that person is found. At occasions where distressed people were rejected
from entering State territory it was never questioned, if the people
should be saved at all.[^97] This can be called a clue that extending
the search and rescue obligation to private individuals (in contrast to
seafarers) evolved to be part of the longstanding State practice of
rendering assistance to people in distress. As an example the
Disembarkation Resettlement Offers Scheme (DISERO) from the 1970s can be
named. DISERO resulted from the cooperation of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and many States which prepared the
allowance of disembarkation in exchange for guarantees that other States
would grant permanent protection to the refugees.[^98] As an example for
early State practice the *Tampa* incident[^99] which took place near the
Australian Christmas islands in 2001 shall be considered. The Australian
RCC ordered the *Tampa* to rescue people in distress and later, refused
the ship entrance to its territory.[^100] Nevertheless, the initial
response was to acknowledge the right of the distressed people to be
rescued.

In comparison to this, the so called "refugee crisis" in the
Mediterranean, which peaked in 2015 can be considered as an example,
where the practice of States was similar. The question never was if the
people in distress had to be saved, but where they were to be
disembarked.[^101] Moreover, one may say, that in addition to the State
practice[^102] saving all people from distress is not done voluntarily
but because the State community recognizes it as a legal obligation.

Once clarified that every person in distress falls within the scope of
the SAR regime, it is now time to analyse what obligations the States
have regarding the disembarkment of survivors.

### Disembarkation under the law of the Sea

The first legal foundation seems to be the law of the sea as it
constitutes the most specialized regulations for seafarers.\
The center of dispute poses chapter 3 paragraph 3.1.9 SAR 1979:

*Parties shall co-ordinate and co-operate to ensure that masters of
ships providing assistance by embarking persons in distress at sea are
released from their obligations with minimum further deviation from the
ships´ intended voyage, (...) The Party responsible for the search and
rescue region in which such assistance is rendered shall exercise
primary responsibility for ensuring such co-ordination and co-operation
occurs, so that survivors assisted are disembarked from the assisting
ship and delivered to a place of safety,(...).*

#### Constitution of a Place of Safety

The first term from the regulation which must be considered is the term
"place of safety". The term is used in chapter 3 paragraphs 3.1.9 and
1.3.2 SAR 1979 but never defined. A definition of a place of safety can
only be taken from chapter paragraph 6.12 of the IMO Guidelines on the
Treatment of Persons Rescued at Sea.[^103]\
The IMO Guidelines were introduced by the Maritime Safety Committee to
clarify procedures to provide survivors with a place of safety. The
Guidelines complement the SAR 1979 which is why they are referred to at
this point.\
Chapter 6 paragraph 6.12 of the Guidelines defines a place of safety as
a location where rescue missions terminate. The place of safety is one
where the life of the survivors is no longer threatened, as their basic
human needs can be met and arrangements for transportation to the
survivor´s next or final destination can be undertaken.[^104]\
Thus, what constitutes a place of safety must be evaluated on a case by
case decision.[^105] The place of safety may therefore be aboard a
vessel, a facility at sea or the most common place ashore.\
Some authors state that the rescue unit itself can only provisionally be
the place of safety.[^106] In fact, chapter 6 paragraph 6.13 of the IMO
Guidelines stipulates that an assisting ship should not be considered a
place of safety solely based on the fact that the survivors are no
longer in immediate danger, although the ship is capable of providing
the survivors with the necessary support.[^107] Taking paragraph 6.13 of
the Guidelines literally, a ship may be a place of safety if the reason
therefore is not only the absence of lethal threat. If a capable ship
could not represent a permanent place of safety, this would lead to
perplexing results. The term "temporary" means the status vanishes after
time. It is not clear what a "temporary" time is. Once the "temporary
state" ceases, the vessel would become an unsuitable place of safety,
thereby making it challenging to say in what status the person is. If
the person aboard was in distress, the responsible SAR State would be
obliged to perform SAR services. However, SAR services are to be aimed
at distressed people, and the people on the vessel are *de facto* not in
distress. In the opinion of the author a vessel can therefore be a
terminal place of safety.

Lastly, it remains to be stated that not always the port of the
responsible State of the Rescue area is the one most suitable for the
sake of SAR.[^108] Therefore the greatest possible flexibility is needed
for determining the most suitable place of safety as every SAR situation
is different. If the SAR 1979 was too strict in its obligations there
would be no room for these dynamics.

#### State Obligations

Chapter 3 paragraph 3.1.9 SAR 1979 emphasizes the duty of the
responsible State to coordinate and cooperate to release the assisting
vessels of their duties to assist vessels in distress. It is noticeable,
that the convention does not provide a definition for the term
"assistance", although it is used in several important regulations such
as chapter 2 and 3 paragraphs 2.1.10 and 3.1.9 SAR 1979.\
Hence, it can be followed, that "assistance" contains a narrower scope
of obligation than the term "rescue", which is defined as "*(A)n
operation to retrieve persons in distress, provide for their initial
medical or other needs, and deliver them to a place of safety*".[^109]\
Although the usage of the term "rescue" can be described as
narrow,[^110] and therefore a lack of legal obligation, the term could
not have been used in chapter 3 paragraph 3.1.9 SAR 1979 as it
contradicts the intention of the provision to release the masters of the
assisting ships from their obligations to minimize deviation of the
ships voyage. If the term "rescue" would have been used, the Flag States
would be obliged to order the ships "rescuing" the distressed people to
provide for the survivors needs and bring them to a place of safety
other than the vessel itself. The same is true for paragraph 2.1.10 SAR
as every vessel providing assistance would then have to be obliged by
the responsible State to deliver the rescues to a place of safety
contrary to chapter 3 paragraph 3.1.9 SAR 1979.[^111]

Provision 3.1.9 SAR 1979 stipulates the "primary responsibility" of the
States as to ensure, that co-ordination and co-operation "occurs",[^112]
with the goal of disembarkment from the assisting ship to a place of
safety. However, it is by no means clear, what the measures are, the
responsible State is required to take. Some authors take the view that
States had the duty to secure a certain result.[^113] Another one says
the disembarkation to a permanent place of safety is only mandatory for
the responsible State of the SAR region if no other State offers
disembarkation to their territory.[^114] At least, as some say, this
applies if there are no other options.[^115]\
These opinions derive from the expressed intentions of the drafters
which describe the intent of chapter 3 paragraph 3.1.9 as to provide a
place of safety within reasonable time [^116] and the interpretation of
paragraph 2.5 of the Guidelines of the IMO with the same wording.[^117]
Paragraph 2.5 of the IMO Guidelines furthermore stipulates the intention
of chapter 3 paragraph 3.1.9 SAR 1979 as a provision to make the States
responsible for providing a place of safety. Taking this wording
literally the responsible State had to provide a place of safety.
Although this seems like an alluringly easy answer, the wording of 3.1.9
SAR 1979 is not open to that interpretation as it does not speak of a
State responsibility of providing a place of safety.[^118]\
There is clearly a dissent in the scope of the regulations. It needs to
be decided which of the frameworks prevails.\
Because the IMO Guidelines have no binding effect of its own they cannot
precede the regulations of the SAR 1979.[^119] This can be followed off
the Guidelines´ preamble which states the "adoption of the Guidelines"
in contrast to the preamble on the 2004 amendment which states an
"adoption of amendments to the convention." Amendments are reforms with
a legal basis in the convention, guidelines are not.\
Moreover, chapter 3 paragraph 3.1.9 SAR1979 outmaneuvers the Guidelines
itself as it states that the Guidelines should only be taken "into
account".[^120] The choice of wording displays the aspiration of the
States as it is very vague and has been therefore called a "diplomatic
formula compromise".[^121]

This has led to the question how a State is supposed to fulfil the
primary responsibility of ensuring cooperation and coordination leading
to the survivors´ disembarkation if all other States refuse to allow the
disembarkation in its territory.[^122] To the background of
practicability, it is comprehensible that the result of survivors
staying on a boat for weeks, not knowing what is going to happen next
can be unsatisfactory. The rescued people will have to be disembarked
somewhere. The lack of regulation of this question is exactly why this
topic is so controversial. The written obligations and the system of the
convention are clear: the masters of the vessels shall be obliged to
render assistance, and the States are explicitly solely obliged to
coordinate and to cooperate with the goal of disembarkation to a place
of safety. This is perfectly legitimate as the aim of the SAR 1979 is to
bring situations of distress to an immediate end. Ultimately, the
convention is a treaty, made by the member States which want to be as
less obliged as possible.

### Disembarkation under the principle of non refoulment included in the SAR framework

Whether a State duty to disembarkation exists, not solely under the law
of the sea but under the principle of non-refoulment in conjunction with
the law of the sea, is heavily debated amongst legal scholars. The
principle of non-refoulment is said to constitute a *de facto* State
duty to disembarkation on State territory in situations of saving
refugees at sea.\
The principle of non-refoulment is stipulated in Art. 33 of the
Convention Relating to the status of Refugees (Geneva Convention).
Thereby, returning a refugee[^123] to territory where life or freedom
would be threatened is prohibited.[^124]\
It seems, that this prohibition could derive from the SAR 1979 in the
same way as the SAR is the pertinent convention for persons saved at
sea.[^125] If the SAR 1979 prohibited disembarkation to territory where
the survivor would be threatened, a right not to be disembarked in
certain States would be the result. This right could be included in the
definition of place of safety as a place where a person is threatened
cannot be referred to as "safe" place. However, if this is the case is
controversial.\
Due to a lack of inherent definition of a place of safety in the SAR
1979, applying other framework has to be considered. The IMO Guidelines
define a place of safety as a place where the safety of life is no
longer threatened.[^126] A few arguments speak in favor of the
overlapping meaning of the definition in the SAR 1979 and the IMO
Guidelines. The definition from the Guidelines is the only one existing
in the pertinent framework. The Guidelines complement the SAR´s
regulations whenever it is not comprehensive. This does not mean that
the Guidelines are per se binding but certain definitions can be taken
over. Furthermore, taking over the definition of place of safety to SAR
1979 does not result in any further proceeding obligations for States.\
Following the arguments in favor of the takeover, the scope of the
definition has to be interpreted. The wording "*no longer threatened*"
can be conceived as that only threats that existed before and continued
at the place where the person is brought to fall under the definition.
This easily applies to distress at sea. Strictly speaking the same can
be said for the situation of a refugee: formerly in danger in the
country seeking refuge from, the refugee is then saved from this
immanent threat. Brought back to the same place, the same threat
continues. Another fact that speaks in favor of the inclusion of the
principle of non refoulment in the assessment of a place of safety is
paragraph 6.17 of the Guidelines. This regulation stands in the same
chapter as the definition and qualifies the place of safety by stating
that the avoidance of disembarking survivors in territories, where the
lives of those would be threatened are to be taken into consideration.

However, the above-mentioned questions only apply when it comes to
refugee law. Therefore chapter 6 paragraphs 6.19 and 6.20 of the
Guidelines have to be considered. These provisions stipulate "Non-SAR
considerations" which cover survivors who are migrants or asylum
seekers.[^127] Those are within the scope of responsibility of the
appropriate authorities, at the place of safety.[^128] The regulation
ensures the inapplicability of SAR law once the people are at a place of
safety.[^129]

Following this, it can be concluded, that the principle of
non-refoulment is not included in the SAR framework.

### Disembarkation under general refugee law

The general rule of the Geneva convention has to be applied as the next
closest framework for questions of refugees.\
The overall argument to conclude a (at least temporary) right of
disembarkation under refugee law is as follows: because the Geneva
convention in Art.32 requires the parties to examine the status of each
person which could possibly have a right to asylum thoroughly, the
refugees have to be brought ashore because this examination can not
adequately take place on the vessel.[^130] This argument is partially
supported by the UNHCR Expert "Roundtable" when it comes to private
vessels. The decision was taken, that non-governmental ships are
inadequate for these examinations.[^131] Because the convention is
applicable in the territorial waters, this view is agreed on by a
majority regarding rescuees who already entered these waters.[^132] This
approach seems to be adequate as it contains appropriate solutions for
the situations. A person entering the State on land territory can submit
his claim more easily than one entering State territory by sea. Both
refugees are entitled to the same possibilities of submitting their
claim. Due to the principle of equal treatment this approach is
adequate.\
Especially, if there are many people rescued at once it is often not
possible for the State to examine the claims made by the refugees as
easily as ashore. Also, these examinations have to be fair and
effective[^133] and have to be open to effective remedies against the
decisions.[^134] This leads to the practical obligation to disembark the
survivors on the land territory as long as examination of the status and
the time for appeal last.

If the legal outcome is the same when refugees did not yet enter zones
under State sovereignty, the legal debate is far more controversial.
This is because the extraterritorial applicability of the Geneva
convention is disputed.[^135] If the convention is not to be applied in
the EEZ or the High Seas, a right of disembarkation like the one above
mentioned cannot follow.

### Conclusion to the right of Disembarkation

A right of disembarkation from a safe vessel to a particular place can
only result from other international law than the law of the sea. There
seems to be certainty regarding a right of disembarkation as long as the
examination of the refugee status goes if this cannot be done on the
vessel. Thus, this goes only if the refugee accessed territorial waters
of the State. If the person is saved from distress in the EEZ or the
High Seas, there is no right to disembarkation to a particular place.
Nevertheless, the person has to be disembarked somewhere. Thus, none of
the relevant treaties addresses this adequately. In practice if no State
is willing to allow disembarkation there are only a few practical
choices left 1st disembarkation to the nearest port 2nd disembarkation
to the port of the Flag State 3rd disembarkation to the responsible
State of the SAR Region.\
From a law of the sea perspective, there is no obligation of the coastal
State to accept disembarkation. From a human rights perspective there is
no obligation to accept disembarkation to a specific State. This applies
to everyone in distress and not only refugees. Thus the problem
practically only arises in the context of refugees.

## Upcoming changes to Search and Rescue at Sea

The only newly adopted amendments important to SAR are amendments
regarding the SOLAS 1974 convention, which are going to enter into force
in 2024.[^136] These amendments include regulations for the fire safety
systems, life-saving appliances and general renovations of the
requirements for lifeboats. Furthermore, chapter 2 of SOLAS will be
adopted and will then include regulations for mooring and towing
arrangements.\
There are no changes made regarding the right of disembarkation.
Concerning the ongoing discussion in Europe this comes not as a big
surprise. Nevertheless seeing that the SAR framework is adopting
frequently is a good sign for safety at sea in general.

## Final remarks

Overall, SAR has been a very successful evolution. From the beginning of
the first written codification of the obligation to render assistance to
persons in distress to an elaborate framework for merchant vessels has
developed considerably. Notwithstanding rendering assistance at sea is
still very complicated due to the size and sea-immanent difficulties of
the ocean, the safety of going to sea has increased a lot. This can be
noted in the fact that nowadays more and more people are going to sea
just for leisure activities. Therefore, the consignees of SAR services
have changed significantly. The States now have to provide their
services to people which the States did not include initially such as
refugees and leisure yacht owners.\
It may come to question if a new system of compensation, e.g. an
insurance for every ship registered in the member States, should be
established. If the responsible SAR State is affected i.a.
environmentally, the coastal State would not have the sole financial
burden.[^137]\
In light of the far more controversial lack of regulation that the SAR
framework pertains, finding a legal solution to the right of
disembarkation seems desirable. A clear separational line must be drawn
to distinguish between the question of a right to disembarkation of
non-refugees and refugees.\
For the former category there does not seem to be a problem concerning
disembarkment. There is no need for an additional regulation or
framework as the distress situation is over and the survivor will at
some point be disembarked to a place from whereon he or she can get to
their final destination. For the latter category (refugees), the lack of
a binding regulation is far more concerning. Waiting aboard a vessel for
several weeks is a possible result of being rescued at sea. Because the
situation is so different to when non-refugees are rescued, it does not
seem to be the right step to solely apply SAR law to these situations.
SAR´s function has always been to improve safety at sea. SAR missions´
are aimed at rescuing persons from distress and bringing them to a place
of safety. A person planning to stay for a long period of time at the
place disembarked to, additionally making an asylum claim can become a
burden for the State. This is not a situation the SAR framework should
be applicable to.

A few options of new regulations can be considered. 1. Additionally to
the definition of a place of safety, a legal obligation to the SAR
conventions could be amended stipulating the obligation to disembark
survivors at a certain place. Thus, this proposal will presumably not be
met with applause as even the 2004 amendment, introducing the obligation
to coordinate and cooperate with the goal to provide a place of safety
did not get ratified by important States such as Malta. Since these
conventions where not particularly binding, more binding conventions
might have little chance of being successfully ratified. Furthermore the
question what the best suitable place of safety is would complicate
future negotiations as there is a variety of possibilities.[^138] 2. An
alternative to changing the SAR framework could be the establishment of
a set of rules concerning the special situation of refugees at sea. This
could be done by obliging the coastal State to firstly grant the
rescuing vessel entry into the port and secondly let the refugees enter
the territory. These regulations would have to be complemented with a
system of distributing the asylum seekers and refugees amongst the State
community otherwise, the coastal State could lack motivation to grant
the people entry into its territory. This approach would best work with
many States in near geographical and or political proximity because
States far from sharing political or geographical adjacency would
supposedly not be open to such a collaboration. This approach is
currently discussed between the EU member States[^139] and is maybe a
good way of balancing State interests albeit more efficient ways of
dealing with migration can be observed in dealing with the root of
migration. Transitionally, situations such as in the Mediterranean are
best dealt with by multilateral agreements.

The project started as an experimental seminar in which students contributed articles related to the law of the Sea while using a disruptive technological approach in order to overcome existing interdisciplinary barriers between computer science and law. This technological approach ensures that contributions can easily be updated by the author and makes the editorial process much more effective inter alia through the possibility of a simultaneous review process.

The Hamburg Open Book of the Law of the Sea uses a unanimous bibliography-software in order to guarantee a consistent way of citation throughout all articles published. The use of a unanimous bibliography also ensures that the book itself will only have one library which every contributor can rely on. During the distinctive workflow of HopenLos the paper can then be published directly onto the website without the widely known adjustment to Publisher's own guidelines (concerning inter alia headings or the way of citation) that scholars encounter when publishing their papers.

The general international recognition of Hamburg for its harbour and the location of the International Tribunal for the law of the Sea, makes Hamburg a basin for international scholars and practitioners in the field of the law of the Sea. Furthermore, the University of Hamburg is the only University in Germany which offers the opportunity for legal students to focus on the law of the Sea during their studies. This is why the publishers wish for a wider representation of the University in the field of scientific research and picked up the project to provide an easy and free access to scientific sources in the law of the Sea for international scholars and those who are interested in the field of the law of the Sea.

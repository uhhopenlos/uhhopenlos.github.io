The Hamburg Open Book of the Law of the Sea is an open-source book for legal scholars who are interested in the Law of the Sea. The Bookâ€™s focus lies on the international law of the Sea and seeks to provide easily accessible sources to students, researchers, and practitioners.

The book is independent from the University of Hamburg. Contributions are selected by an editorial board that is strongly cooperating with the University of Hamburg as well as other researchers in the field.

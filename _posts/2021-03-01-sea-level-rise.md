<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Climate change and its consequences are undeniably in the top ranks
   of the most pressing issues of our time and yet still ignored by many.<a
      href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> It is becoming an increasingly
   strong and destructive phenomenon that requires the attention of legal
   framework approaches to address its impacts. The window of opportunity
   stands slightly open, calling for swift but cautious decision making, as
   the next ten years have been heralded in scientific assessments as a
   ‘critical decade’ for action on climate change.<a href="#fn2"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> In
   the field of the international law of the sea, the rise of the sea level
   is of particular interest, as it raises questions concerning the
   determination of (shifting) baselines, the reduction of coastal State
   territory and even the disappearance of States.
</p>
<p>According to the worst-case scenario stated by the Special Report on
   the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate of the Intergovernmental
   Panel on Climate Change<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, the sea level is estimated to rise
   between 0,61 m and 1,10 m until 2100 on global average.<a href="#fn4"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>
   Even from a slightly more optimistic perspective, the sea level is
   likely to increase about 29 cm.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> When taking a look at
   the newest scientific data, that slight optimism is likely to disappear
   again though, as current sea levels are higher than any forecast
   expected them to be by now.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Those figures may seem
   insignificant at first glance, but already induce remarkable and
   somewhat disastrous consequences for some States. For instance, it is
   estimated that with a rise of only 21 cm of the sea level, 316-411
   million people will be affected by this global development by 2060.<a
      href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> A living example of what lies ahead
   is the Republic of Kiribati, a State whose territory consists of
   low-lying islands and atolls in the Central Pacific. The rising ocean
   has broken through freshwater ponds on some islands, threatening
   numerous communities, some villages will submerge and even whole islands
   were already swallowed by the sea.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> By 2100 Kiribati is
   likely to be completely uninhabitable.<a href="#fn9"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> But
   not only island States are in danger, even ‘regular’ coastal States are
   affected by this progressing development. Sea level rise will cause
   damages to the coastal environment and will ultimately result in the
   disappearance of parts of the territory of the States concerned.<a
      href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>
</p>
<p>Baselines are of great importance for the functioning of the United
   Convention on the Law of the Sea <a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> and therefore also for
   States. According to Art. 8 para 1 UNCLOS, Art. 2 para 1 UNCLOS,
   baselines distinguish internal waters from the territorial sea acting as
   a boarder between territorial sovereignty of States in internal waters
   and the territorial sovereignty in the territorial sea which is
   exercised subject to the Convention and to other rules of international
   law. <a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Furthermore, baselines serve as the
   crucial point for defining other maritime zones. <a href="#fn13"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>
   In each of these zones the coastal State exercises rights, which differ
   in their scope from zone to zone. As the scope of rights differs in
   these zones, the exact classification of these is of great importance,
   especially for coastal States. Normal baselines are linked to or in some
   points of views<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> are the actual low-water line
   according to Art. 5 UNCLOS. If baselines are ambulatory, a rise of the
   sea level will shift them and accordingly the maritime zones landwards.
   Consequently, the range of the rights of coastal States will be <em>de
   facto</em> reduced in terms of the range of the rights into the sea and
   their influence in these areas compared to their actual range. Thence,
   it is in the interest of the affected States to keep the current
   baselines to ensure their influence in the areas concerned.
</p>
<p>Beyond this, the complete vanishing of a State due to sea level rise
   raises additional concerns. Unfortunately, the States especially
   threatened by this extreme consequence are among those, that contributed
   least to climate change itself – small island States. Due to their
   proximity to water, they are especially vulnerable to the marine effects
   of climate change like sea level rise, ocean acidification, marine
   heatwaves, and the increase in cyclone intensity.<a href="#fn15"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>
   Furthermore their maritime zones are usually bigger than their
   territory, which makes them particularly sensitive to possible shrinking
   of their baselines as discussed in the preceding paragraph.
</p>
<p>Additionally, the total disappearance of a State is completely
   unregulated. Neither the UNCLOS, where the regime of islands is
   regulated in Article 121, nor the UNs “Small Island Developing States”<a
      href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> framework which intended to
   strengthen the endangered States, create any procedures for this
   scenario.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> Whilst the interest of the SIDS
   might be to keep their jurisdiction over the parts of the ocean, that
   where once home to their population, the compatibility of this with the
   law of the sea is unclear. Furthermore, not just uncertainty over
   physical, but over the abstract statehood itself arises – closely
   entangled with public international law that requires population,
   territory and government to form a State, the law of the sea might be
   pathbreaking for preserving or dissolving the existence of the country,
   depending on how to judge the submerging turf.<a href="#fn18"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>
</p>
<p>This chapter aims to assess and discuss possible solutions regarding
   the problems raised above within the scope of the UNCLOS. Firstly, it
   will provide an analysis of the impacts of climate change, particularly
   focusing on the rise of the sea level and its consequences for States,
   thus establishing the factual basis for the legal assessment.
   Furthermore, it offers an introduction to the different maritime zones,
   pointing out their core elements.
</p>
<p>The authors will then provide general information about baselines
   under the UNCLOS and will discuss the ambulatory character of those.
   Based on the decision regarding the ambulatory character of baselines,
   the question of legal responses regarding this matter will be at the
   center of this chapter: on the one hand the possible reactions of States
   according with the UNCLOS, and on the other hand the method of
   “freezing” either of current baselines or rather of current outer limits
   of different maritime zones. These options will be compared and
   discussed in light of influencing factors such as the effectiveness of
   each. Ultimately the possibility of the legal incorporation of these
   solutions will be forwarded.
</p>
<p>In hindsight of the SIDS, it is unclear whether disappearing States
   remain entitled to exercise jurisdiction over marine areas, which
   therefore needs further evaluation. As only States are entitled to claim
   maritime zones, the question whether a State could continue to exist if
   its land is completely submerged by the sea or so much of it is under
   water that it cannot sustain a population arises.<a href="#fn19"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>
   Therefore, without a habitable territory or permanent population, the
   existence of low-lying atoll island States becomes increasingly
   uncertain.
</p>
<h2 id="current-state-of-climate-change">Current State of Climate
   Change
</h2>
<p>The impacts of climate change are becoming more noticeable. The
   warming of the climate in general, natural catastrophes, melting of
   glaciers and sea level rise are just some examples of climate change.<a
      href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> These impacts partly correlate with
   each other, as the warming of the climate will lead to the melting of
   glaciers which results in a rise of the sea level. Climate change is a
   process contributed to by different factors. One of these factors are
   greenhouse gases which are mainly caused by humankind.<a href="#fn21"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>
   The rise of greenhouse gases increases the so called greenhouse effect,
   ultimately contributing to climate change and in particular to sea level
   rise. It can be observed, that human beings are major contributors to
   climate change and sea level rise. Besides the sea level rise itself,
   marine spaces are in the course of climate change additionally
   endangered by acidification of the and a temperature rise in the ocean,
   very likely respectively with high confidence caused by human beings
   according to the IPCC.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a>
</p>
<p>Exact forecasts for the sea level rise are not possible, as many
   factors contribute to the rise (for instance, the amount of greenhouse
   gases emitted by humans). Because of these uncertainties, there exist
   different scenarios and studies about the sea level rise weighing
   factors differently. The IPCC reviewed all relevant studies and combined
   them into a forecast about what rise can be expected by 2100. According
   to the IPCC the sea level “<em>will rise between 0.43 m (…) and 0.84 m
   (…) by 2100 (…) relative to 1986-2005</em>” on global average.<a
      href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> According to the worst-case
   scenario taken into account by the IPCC, the sea level will rise up to
   110 cm.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> Other studies have even suggested
   shifts from 75 to 190 cm until 2100.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> However, as these
   figures denote global average sea level rise, regional experiences will
   vary widely, with, in some cases, a much greater degree of severity
   (e.g.:Eastern Pacific and Western North Atlantic increase less than
   global rise of sea level, whilst the Western Pacific and Central Indian
   Ocean increase the most).<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a>
</p>
<p>Without significant intervention on our part, climate change has the
   potential to activate multiple interacting “tipping points”<a
      href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a>, such as the loss of the Amazon
   rainforest or the West Antarctic ice sheet, what may greatly accelerate
   the process of sea level rise.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> Evidence suggests that
   thresholds of the aforementioned tipping points will be surpassed
   imminently - as such, the optimal policy recommendations to prevent the
   disastrous onset of climate change align with those of the recent IPCC
   report: global warming must be limited to 1.5 °C; therefore, an
   emergency response is required. <a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a>
</p>
<p>According to the IPCC low-lying small island States are among the
   most affected by climate change and in particular by sea level rise, as
   they are wholly surrounded by water.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> Especially little
   islands are vulnerable, as they have a high ratio of coastline compared
   to their land mass.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> Although the extreme effects of the
   rising sea (loss of territory) will not be experienced in the same
   intensity on every coastline<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a>, the less obvious
   results of the rising sea will affect all States falling into this
   category: flooding, erosion, loss and change of ecosystem, salinisation
   of soils, ground and surface water and impeded drainage<a href="#fn33"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a>,
   marine heatwaves, and the increase in cyclone intensity.<a href="#fn34"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a>
   As the SIDS have limited capacity to adapt to those circumstances and
   have their population and infrastructure located close to the coasts,
   exposing these features to the impacts of climate change, the impact of
   these consequences worsens.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a>
</p>
<p>Against this background, unsurprisingly it is projected that among
   the first States that will wholly disappear are mainly small island
   States. The Republic of Kiribati is an example for such a State. It is
   estimated that the island State will wholly disappear by 2100 at
   latest.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> But not only such low-lying island
   States are affected, even larger States will be. Worldwide, the sum of
   all coastline equals about 1 Million km, which shows the significant
   extent of coastline affected by sea level rise.<a href="#fn37"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a>
   Some of those coastline States lie beneath the sea level. This does not
   just include SIDS: the Netherlands show a vivid example, as around 25 %
   of the State territory lies beneath the sea level.<a href="#fn38"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a>
   Without protectional steps (e.g. dykes) this land would be flooded and
   life would not be possible as it is nowadays.<a href="#fn39"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a>
</p>
<h2 id="maritime-zones-under-the-unclos">Maritime Zones under the
   UNCLOS
</h2>
<p>The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea prescribes a
   spatial division of the ocean to reconcile the interests of States.<a
      href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> Through this division, several
   different zones with differing rights over each zones are established.
   Those zones can be categorized by the influence of the coastal States in
   these zones. On the one hand, zones which lie beyond national
   jurisdiction can be identified.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> On the other hand
   there are zones which are under the national jurisdiction of the coastal
   States. These can be further differentiated into zones over which the
   State enjoys sovereignty<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> and zones to which the
   coastal State has been allocated individual sovereign rights, or
   jurisdiction respectively<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a>. To be able to
   understand the problematics originating from rising sea levels, we have
   to understand the maritime zones and their effects.
</p>
<h3 id="internal-waters">Internal Waters</h3>
<p>Internal waters are “<em>those waters which lie landward of the
   baseline from which the territorial sea is measured</em>”<a href="#fn44"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a>,
   but do not include rivers, lakes and other land-locked waters or waters
   within the land territory.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> According to Art. 2
   para 1 UNCLOS States enjoy full and exclusive territorial sovereignty
   over internal waters as they do over other territory. There is no right
   of innocent passage in or rather through this zone, however, special
   circumstances<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a> can induce lawful ways of
   passage.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a>
</p>
<h3 id="territorial-sea">Territorial Sea</h3>
<p>“<em>The sovereignty of a coastal State extends beyond its land
   territory and internal waters (…) to an adjacent belt of sea, described
   as the territorial sea (.)</em>”<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a>, which can be
   established to a maximum breadth of 12 nautical miles measured from the
   baseline.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a> These rights extend not only on the
   surface but also to the seabed and subsoil, as well as vertically to
   airspace,<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a> but, in contrast to the internal
   waters, can only be “<em>exercised subject to the Convention and to
   other rules of international Law</em>”<a href="#fn51"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a>.
   Furthermore, the coastal States’ rights are limited by the passage
   rights of other States, including innocent passage through the
   territorial sea and transit passage through international straits.<a
      href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a> Thus, it can be concluded that the
   coastal State enjoys a somewhat limited territorial sovereignty over the
   territorial sea.
</p>
<h3 id="archipelagic-waters">Archipelagic Waters</h3>
<p>An archipelago is “<em>a group of islands, including parts of
   islands, interconnecting waters and other natural features which are so
   closely interrelated that such islands, waters and other natural
   features form an intrinsic geographical, economic and political entity,
   or which historically have been regarded as such</em>”.<a href="#fn53"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a>
   Archipelagic States may draw archipelagic baselines connecting the
   outermost points of the outermost islands of the archipelago and
   calculate the breadth of their maritime zones from those lines. The
   waters enclosed by those lines fall under the regime of archipelagic
   waters.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a> Archipelagic States have
   sovereignty over the waters enclosed by the archipelagic baselines,
   which also “<em>extends to the air space over the archipelagic waters as
   well as to their bed and subsoil, and the resources contained
   therein(.)</em>” according to Art. 49 para 1, 2 UNCLOS. However,
   according to Art. 49 para 3, the sovereignty “<em>is exercised subject
   to this Part.</em>”
</p>
<h3 id="the-contiguous-zone">The Contiguous Zone</h3>
<p>The contiguous zone exists to bolster a coastal States law
   enforcement capacity.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a> There, it can exercise control to
   prevent violations of its customs and other financial laws, immigration
   or health laws and other related regulations on its territory or its
   territorial sea.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a> It must not extend more than 24
   nautical miles beyond the baseline.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref57" role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a>
</p>
<h3 id="the-exclusive-economic-zone">The Exclusive Economic Zone</h3>
<p>The exclusive economic zone <a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref"
   id="fnref58" role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a> is an area beyond and
   adjacent to the territorial sea, where it establishes a confined and
   specific legal regime. This zone can reach a maximum breadth of 200
   nautical miles measured from the coastal States baseline<a href="#fn59"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59" role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a>,
   which leads to a 38% coverage of the whole ocean, when combining the
   worlds EEZs.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a> In this area, the coastal State
   holds sovereign rights for the purpose of exploration, exploitation,
   conservation and management of the living (such as fish) and non-living
   natural resources (such as oil and gas) of the waters above the seabed,
   the seabed itself and its subsoil, as well as jurisdiction with regard
   to the construction and use of artificial islands, facilities and
   structures, scientific marine research and the protection and
   preservation of the marine environment.<a href="#fn61"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61" role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a>
   According to Art. 56 para 3 UNCLOS “<em>(t)he rights (…) with respect to
   the seabed and subsoil shall be exercised in accordance with Part VI
   (.)</em>” of the UNCLOS dedicated to the continental shelf. In the EEZ
   of a coastal State other States enjoy certain freedoms in accordance
   with Art. 58 para 1 UNCLOS. Also, Art. 88 - 115 UNCLOS (relating to high
   seas regime), apply to the EEZ as far as they are compatible with the
   regulations stated in Part V of the Convention.<a href="#fn62"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62" role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a>
   This means, unlike the territorial sea and the contiguous zone, the EEZ
   only allows for the previously mentioned rights and jurisdiction
   respectively and the law enforcement capacity to protect those rights.<a
      href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a> However, it does not give a coastal
   State the right to prohibit or limit freedom of navigation or
   overflight.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a>
</p>
<h3 id="the-continental-shelf">The Continental Shelf</h3>
<p>The continental shelf is a natural seaward extension of the land
   mass.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>65</sup></a> This seaward extension is typically
   consisting of a gradual slope (the continental shelf proper), followed
   by a steep slope (the continental slope), and then a more gradual slope
   leading to the deep seabed floor.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref66" role="doc-noteref"><sup>66</sup></a> To this prolongation
   of its land territory to the outer edge of the continental margin, Art.
   77 para 1 UNCLOS allocates a State “<em>sovereign rights for the purpose
   of exploring it and exploiting its natural resources.</em>” However, the
   Convention offers an option for legal fiction to measure “<em>a distance
   of 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the
   territorial sea is measured where the outer edge of the continental
   margin does not extend up to that distance</em>”<a href="#fn67"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67" role="doc-noteref"><sup>67</sup></a>,
   to avoid iniquities for States that do not possess such geological
   conditions. The rights of the coastal State over the continental shelf
   exist <em>ipso iure</em>,<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref68" role="doc-noteref"><sup>68</sup></a> however, if a State
   possesses a continental shelf that extends beyond 200 nautical miles,
   the limits of the continental shelf must be established on the basis of
   the recommendations of the Commission on the Limits of the Continental
   Shelf to become final and binding.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref69" role="doc-noteref"><sup>69</sup></a>
</p>
<h3 id="the-high-seas-and-the-area">The High Seas and “The Area”</h3>
<p>According to the UNCLOS, the ocean surface and the water column
   beyond the EEZ are referred to as the high seas, whilst the seabed
   beyond the limits of national sovereignty is summarized under the
   neutral collective term <em>“Area”</em>.<a href="#fn70"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70" role="doc-noteref"><sup>70</sup></a>
   The high seas and the area are international common spaces,<a

<h3 id="functions-and-purposes-of-baselines">Functions and Purposes of
   Baselines
</h3>
<p>Against the background of the differing scope of rights of the
   coastal State in each maritime zone, it is necessary to establish these.
   The UNCLOS bases the division of marine spaces on distances, starting
   the measurement from the baseline.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref76" role="doc-noteref"><sup>76</sup></a> According to Art. 3
   UNCLOS “<em>every State has the right to establish the breadth of its
   territorial sea up to a limit not exceeding 12 nautical miles,
   <strong>measured from baselines</strong></em> <em>determined in
   accordance with this Convention.</em>” The same point of origin applies
   for the delineation of the the EEZ, the contiguous zone as well as the
   continental shelf. <a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>77</sup></a> Thence, the first function of
   baselines can be identified: they act as a key point to define the
   different maritime zones.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref78" role="doc-noteref"><sup>78</sup></a>
</p>
<p>According to Art. 2 para 1 UNCLOS “<em>the sovereignty of a coastal
   State extends, beyond its land territory and internal waters, (…) to an
   adjacent belt of the sea, described as the territorial sea.</em>” The
   paranthesis of “<em>beyond its land territory and internal waters</em>”
   indicates that coastal States enjoy the same rights in both the land
   territory and in internal waters, namely territorial sovereignty.<a
      href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>79</sup></a> Internal waters lie according to
   Art. 8 para 1 UNCLOS “<em>(…) on the landward side of the baseline of
   the territorial sea (…)</em>”. Thus, baselines distinguish internal
   waters from the territorial sea acting as a boarder between territorial
   sovereignty of States in internal waters and the sovereignty which is
   according to Art. 2 para 3 “<em>(…) exercised subject to this Convention
   and to other rules of international law (.)</em>” in the territorial
   sea.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>80</sup></a>
</p>
<p>Furthermore, baselines become important where two States share
   overlapping or adjacent maritime areas addressed inter alia by Art. 15
   UNCLOS. To agree on maritime boundaries and the limits of each marine
   zone between those States or if failing a delimitation by court,
   baselines serve as a starting point to identify an equidistance or a
   median line.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>81</sup></a>
</p>
<p>Thence, baselines play an important role in the international law of
   the sea and have essentially a threefold purpose:<a href="#fn82"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82" role="doc-noteref"><sup>82</sup></a>
   they serve as a starting point for measuring different maritime zones,
   they divide the land territory and the internal waters from the
   territorial sea and are relevant for overlapping zones between two (or
   more) States.

<h3 id="methods-of-establishing-baselines-under-unclos">Methods of
   establishing Baselines under UNCLOS
</h3>
<p>Starting with the normal baselines, this part provides an overview
   over the different methods of establishing baselines in accordance with
   the UNCLOS.
</p>
<h4 id="normal-baseline">Normal baseline</h4>
<p>The normal baseline is defined by Art. 5 UNCLOS as “<em>(…)the
   low-water line along the coast as marked on large-scale charts
   officially recognized by the coastal State.</em>”. This definition
   consists of two elements, <em>the low-water line</em> and the official
   marking on the <em>large-scale charts</em> by the coastal State, which
   will be examined in the following.
</p>
<h5 id="low-water-line">Low-water line</h5>
<p>The Convention does not offer a precise definition regarding the term
   “<em>low-water line</em>”.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref83" role="doc-noteref"><sup>83</sup></a> Thus, States enjoy
   discretion in choosing an appropriate low-water line.<a href="#fn84"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84" role="doc-noteref"><sup>84</sup></a>
   The level of the low-water line is dependent on the vertical datum which
   is used as the level of the sea rises or falls (because of tides).<a
      href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>85</sup></a> The vertical datum is neither
   defined in the UNCLOS, leading to various possibilities in choosing the
   correct vertical datum, ultimately giving States also discretion in that
   regard as any vertical datum <a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref86" role="doc-noteref"><sup>86</sup></a> used by a State is
   legitimate.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>87</sup></a> The “right” choosing of the
   vertical datum cannot be underestimated for States as the low-water line
   will move in accordance to the datum used either land- or seawards.<a
      href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>88</sup></a> However, it can be observed that
   the LAT has been used by most States as this is the preferred datum by
   the International Hydrographic Organization.<a href="#fn89"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89" role="doc-noteref"><sup>89</sup></a>
   The LAT can be described as “<em>the lowest tide level which can be
   predicted to occur under average meteorological conditions and under any
   combination of astronomical conditions.</em>”<a href="#fn90"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90" role="doc-noteref"><sup>90</sup></a>
   This seems to be advantageous as the low-water line of the LAT lies
   further seawards, ultimately increasing marine entitlements as well as
   acting as an “<em>aid to safe navigation</em>.”<a href="#fn91"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>91</sup></a>
</p>
<h5 id="charts">Charts</h5>
<p>The second element of Art. 5 UNCLOS contains charts, on which the
   low-water line is marked on. The Convention is deficient in providing a
   legal definition of charts. However, charts are usually understood as
   nautical charts.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>92</sup></a> Such can be defined as “<em>a chart
   specifically designed to meet the requirements of marine navigation,
   showing depths of water, nature of bottom, elevations, configurations
   and characteristics of coast, dangers and aids to navigation.</em>”<a
      href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>93</sup></a> Noting this definition, the purpose
   of charts becomes obvious: they serve primarily the function of
   safeguarding the navigation at sea.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref94" role="doc-noteref"><sup>94</sup></a> Therefore, it can be
   concluded that charts mainly adopt to new circumstances merely to draw
   attention to navigational hazards as to act as a navigational aid. <a
      href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>95</sup></a>
</p>
<h5 id="relationship-between-these-elements">Relationship between these
   elements
</h5>
<p>As the low-water line along the coast forms the normal baseline
   “<em>as marked on large-scale charts</em>” the relationship between
   those elements of Art. 5 UNCLOS must be clarified. Essentially, this
   revolves the question if baselines have an ambulatory character or if
   the charted baselines are the decisive legally binding lines. If the
   charted baselines would be the legally binding ones, the sea level rise
   would not affect - speaking legally - the baselines. Thus, the answer to
   this question is of great importance in light of sea level rise. Whether
   or not baselines have an ambulatory character has been subject of legal
   discussion. Two main interpretations can be observed in this regard.
</p>
<p>Firstly, as the Convention is silent on the shifting of baselines
   when actual circumstances change, it is arguable to assume the charted
   baselines to be the legally binding ones, once these are established in
   accordance with the requirements of the Convention.<a href="#fn96"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96" role="doc-noteref"><sup>96</sup></a>
   Additionally, the historical development of Art. 5 UNCLOS might speak
   for this interpretation.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref97" role="doc-noteref"><sup>97</sup></a> In this regard the
   term of “<em>large-scale charts</em>” could be brought forward as a
   point favoring this position, as these “would not be necessary to fix
   the chart datum”.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>98</sup></a> Finally, the English wording
   “<em>as marked on</em>” could also indicate a certain legally binding of
   the charted line.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>99</sup></a>
</p>
<p>Albeit, the International Law Association emphasizes that “charts and
   the stated charted line played an indirect role in defining the word
   ‘low-water’ ”, ultimately concluding that “the original role of the
   charted line was neither to illustrate nor to be the normal baseline”
   and therefore opposing the historical interpretation of the latter
   interpretation.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>100</sup></a> Moreover, supporters of the
   opposite position<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>101</sup></a> strengthening the influence of the
   actual low-water line on the legally binding baseline point out that the
   UNCLOS recognizes a certain state of permanence. Art. 76 para 9 UNCLOS
   states that “<em>(t)he coastal State shall deposit (…) charts and
   relevant information (…)<strong>permanently</strong></em> (emphasis
   added) <em>describing the outer limits of its continental shelf.</em>”
   Also, Art. 7 para 2 UNCLOS addressing straight baselines states that
   “<em>the straight baselines shall remain <strong>effective</strong></em>
   (emphasis added) <em>until changed (…)</em>”. In the regulation
   regarding the normal baseline such a term of permanence is not included.
   Thus, it can be, in turn or by negative implication, concluded that the
   baseline shown on charts is not of a permanent state (argument <em>a
   contrario</em>).<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>102</sup></a> Additionally, an ambulatory
   character would be in line with the principle of “<em>Land dominates the
   Sea</em>” as the baseline would be constituted by the actual
   circumstances and the actual low-water line.<a href="#fn103"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103" role="doc-noteref"><sup>103</sup></a>
   Accompanying with this, the delineation of maritime zones would not be
   decoupled from actual circumstances as these are distance-measured from
   the baseline, ultimately maintaining the community interest in
   non-exclusive marine spaces as the formerly EEZ would fall into the area
   of the high seas (resulting from the principle of the <em>freedom of
   navigation</em>).<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>104</sup></a> Furthermore, the shift of the
   low-water line in direction of the land might cause navigational
   hazards, when it is not shown on charts. In order to prevent these
   hazards, ambulatory baselines would also safeguard the navigation.<a
      href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>105</sup></a> Two judicial decisions, namely the
   ICJ Judgment in the case Nicaragua v. Honduras <a href="#fn106"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106" role="doc-noteref"><sup>106</sup></a>
   as well as the arbitral decision in the arbitration between Guyana and
   Suriname <a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>107</sup></a> seem to tend to an ambulatory
   character of baselines.
</p>
<p>While this a debatable issue, the systematic argument as well as the
   function and purposes of charts argue more convincingly in favor of an
   ambulatory character of baselines. Thus, the preferable view appears to
   be that baselines do have an ambulatory character.
</p>
<p>Howbeit, the position preferring the ambulatory character of
   baselines is divided regarding the point of time, at which States are
   obliged to update their charts. Thinkable is an automatic or real-time
   provision of updates or a requirement for updates only where there are
   significant changes in the coastline. The provision of real-time charts,
   in which every change in the coastal configuration is shown, seems to be
   too impractical as well as too expensive.<a href="#fn108"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108" role="doc-noteref"><sup>108</sup></a>
   In order to safeguard the navigation, charts must be updated at least
   where there are important changes in the coastline.<a href="#fn109"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109" role="doc-noteref"><sup>109</sup></a>
   Thence, it would be mandatory to update the charts at least where there
   are significant changes in the coastline to satisfy the purpose of the
   charts as to prevent navigational hazards.<a href="#fn110"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>110</sup></a>
</p>
<p>To conclude, the ambulatory character of baselines will be taken as a
   basis for the following discussion of solutions regarding the influence
   of sea level rise on baselines. Thus, baselines represent and are the
   actual low-water line regardless the baselines shown on the charts.
   Nonetheless, charts must be updated to fulfill their designated
   function, the safeguarding of navigation, when there are significant
   changes in the coastline.
</p>
<h4 id="other-baselines">Other baselines</h4>
<p>Besides normal baselines in Art. 5 UNCLOS, the Convention provides
   different regulations providing other methods of establishing baselines.
   The purpose of the other methods is to adopt to specific (“subnormal”)
   geographic issues and needs.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref111" role="doc-noteref"><sup>111</sup></a> Concerned by this
   consideration are straight baselines <a href="#fn112"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"

      href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"

   <a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>115</sup></a> as well as the regime of
   archipelagic baselines <a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref116" role="doc-noteref"><sup>116</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>Of certain interest regarding the addressed issue by this paper are
   straight baselines, calling for a short comment on them. According to
   Art. 7 para 1 UNCLOS, it is permitted to draw straight baselines
   “<em>where the coastline is deeply indented and cut into, or if there is
   a fringe of islands along the coast in its immediate vicinity</em>”.
   States can then draw baselines from appropriate points. Where there is a
   delta or a highly unstable coastline exists, the appropriate points may
   lie along the furthest seaward extent of the low-water line according to
   Art. 7 para 2 UNCLOS. In this case, such drawn baselines “<em>remain
   effective until changed by the coastal State</em>”. <a href="#fn117"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117" role="doc-noteref"><sup>117</sup></a>
   However, it is worth noting that “<em>the drawing of straight baselines
   must not depart to any appreciable extent from the general direction of
   the coast (…)</em>” according to Art. 7 para 3 UNCLOS. Details regarding
   straight baselines are highly debatable. For the purpose of this paper,
   a fundamental understanding of straight baselines seems to be
   adequate.
</p>
<h3 id="impacts-of-climate-change-on-baselines">Impacts of Climate
   Change on Baselines
</h3>
<p>Against the background of the ambulatory character of normal
   baselines, these will shift landwards when the low-water line moves
   landward as a consequence of sea level rise. These more landward lying
   baselines would then serve as the crucial base for the measuring of the
   maritime zones, ultimately leading to a shift of these zones in the
   direction of the land compared to the current situation.<a href="#fn118"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118" role="doc-noteref"><sup>118</sup></a>
   Affected by this development will be all distance-measured zones, namely
   the territorial sea, the contiguous zone, the continental shelf<a
      href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>119</sup></a> and the EEZ. Although a shifting
   of baselines landward might seem at first glance insignificant in
   proportion to the breadth of the EEZ (for example a shift of two nm
   landward is comparatively small when looking at the 200 nm breadth of
   the EEZ), it must be noted that such a shift has a proportionally bigger
   influence on the territorial sea.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref120" role="doc-noteref"><sup>120</sup></a> Still, even a loss
   of two nm of the EEZ is of interest for the coastal State, as for
   example the coastal State would lose the possibility of regulating the
   fishery <a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>121</sup></a> in the EEZ <a href="#fn122"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122" role="doc-noteref"><sup>122</sup></a>
   as the “lost” area would fall into the high seas and would be open for
   the usage of all States in accordance with Art. 87 UNCLOS.<a
      href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>123</sup></a> In other words, the influence and
   the rights assigned to the coastal State shift in direction of the land
   going along with a loss of influence in the outermost marine space
   compared to the influence nowadays.
</p>
<p>In addition, it should be taken into account that sea level rise in
   general comes with regional differences, the actual shift of baselines
   will differ from region to region accordingly.<a href="#fn124"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124" role="doc-noteref"><sup>124</sup></a>
   To plasticize this, in some regions a rise of only 50 cm of the sea
   level could lead to a potential shift landwards of tens of kilometers of
   the baselines.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>125</sup></a> In the worst case scenario of a
   complete submerge of a low-lying coastal State baselines of these States

   low-water line runs.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>126</sup></a>
</p>
<p>Summarizing, coastal States potentially face a great loss of
   resources as their claims for different marine spaces shift landwards
   provided an ambulatory character of baselines. Thus, the influence of
   climate change on baselines cannot be underestimated.
</p>
<h2 id="problem-solving-solutions">Problem-solving Solutions</h2>
<p>In reaction to the legal challenges identified above, several
   alternative approaches are discussed in order to face that legal
   challenge. These approaches and the consequences of each will be
   presented and analyzed in the following.
</p>
<h3 id="business-as-usual-actions">“Business as usual”-actions</h3>
<p>First of all, this section focuses on possibilities which are in line
   with the UNCLOS. They are all characterized by the fact that they can be
   undertaken by all treaty parties without “changing” the legal base laid
   down in the UNCLOS in order to minimize the impacts of sea level rise.
   Therefore, these will be called “business as usual”-actions.
</p>
<h4 id="do-nothing-approach">Do-Nothing approach</h4>
<p>The most obvious approach would be a ‘do-nothing’ approach, as
   Schofield points out.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>127</sup></a> Essentially, baselines would be
   left to their fates including all the impacts as aforementioned. <a
      href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>128</sup></a> However, this would not be in the
   interest of States, as they would lose both territory and influence in
   maritime zones seawards when the baselines shift in the direction of the
   land. Especially, States that are endangered by a complete loss of
   territory (as a result of a complete submergence)<a href="#fn129"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129" role="doc-noteref"><sup>129</sup></a>
   would not favor such an approach as these might not posses enough
   territory for a relocation of their population.<a href="#fn130"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130" role="doc-noteref"><sup>130</sup></a>
   Thence, Schofield concludes rightly that such an approach would be
   politically unacceptable.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref131" role="doc-noteref"><sup>131</sup></a> Besides this, a
   “do-nothing” approach seems to be somewhat unfair against the background
   of the responsibility for the climate change leading to sea level rise.
   The most affected States are often not the States that carry the prime
   responsibility for global warming.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref"

</p>
<h4 id="maintaining-current-baselines">Maintaining current
   baselines
</h4>
<p>Another possibility is to maintain the current baseline in an
   artificial way (shoreline protection). Examples can be seen inter alia
   in the use of dykes, sea walls or wave reduction structures.<a
      href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>133</sup></a> Such a protection of baselines is
   in line with public international law. This is the result of the
   practice of States<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>134</sup></a> which has not been challenged by
   other States <a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>135</sup></a>. It can be therefore presumed that
   the artificial maintaining of coastlines is approved by customary
   international law.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>136</sup></a> However, the maintaining of
   baselines will find at some point an end. The costs for the artificial
   maintenance will be high - it is estimated that the protection of
   Okinotorishima cost Japan about 200 million US-Dollar.<a href="#fn137"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137" role="doc-noteref"><sup>137</sup></a>
   Besides the general high costs to preserve the current baseline<a
      href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>138</sup></a>, the effectiveness of this in
   proportion to the costs will decrease, ultimately making such a way
   inappropriate for coastal States.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref139" role="doc-noteref"><sup>139</sup></a> Additionally, this
   approach can have problematic consequences for other States<a

   “knock on effects”<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"

<h4 id="usage-of-and-maintaining-appropriate-points">Usage of and

<p>Against the background of high costs and the ineffectiveness of
   maintaining the whole current baselines, some commentators<a
      href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>143</sup></a> have suggested a greater usage of
   straight baselines in accordance with Art. 7 UNCLOS. They argue that
   States could draw their attention not to the protection of the whole
   baseline, but rather on appropriate points, which could serve as points
   for the drawing of straight baselines in accordance with Art. 7 UNCLOS.

<p>To conclude, the challenges arising from ambulatory baselines can
   partly be handled by existing regulations of the UNCLOS. However, these
   approaches prove to be either unattractive (Do-Nothing approach), too
   expensive (maintaining the whole current baselines), are only working
   until a certain limit (until an appreciable deviation from the

<h3 id="freezing">Freezing</h3>
<p>The idea of decoupling the delineation of the maritime zones from the
   actual low-water line forms the basis of the following approaches. In
   other words, all approaches are informed by the idea of delineating the
   marine zones by a legal fiction regardless the actual circumstances.
   Such a legal delineation is often referred to with the term of
   “freezing” of current limits.

<p>Some scholars<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"
   role="doc-noteref"><sup>162</sup></a> have suggested to freeze
   baselines, making them in essence legally binding. This fiction
   correlates with keeping the outer limits as well, as these are
   distance-measured from the baseline.<a href="#fn163"

      href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>164</sup></a>. However, this approach can be
   reached by the freezing of the baselines as (most of) the outer limits
   are established by distance from the baseline. As the zones would still
   be determined from the baselines, most of them would keep their
   designated breadth.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>165</sup></a> Only internal waters would
   increase when baselines do not ambulate (at least in a legal sense) any
   more.<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>166</sup></a> Thus, the territory of a State
   would grow larger (as far as the baselines are), extending territorial
   sovereignty of States. This means that this increasing area would not be
   subject to the UNCLOS any more, as internal waters are not addressed by
   the UNCLOS.<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>167</sup></a> In consequence, this area becomes
   a restricted area for third States (as in principle no passage rights
   apply within internal waters.). In the case of a complete submergence of
   an island or State this approach would lead to a strange situation: even
   in such a case baselines, national territory and the related zones will
   remain regardless the actual circumstances. Following this, the ocean
   would then at some parts be peppered with spaces related to the full
   sovereignty of an already disappeared (part of a) State. Essentially,
   this would mean that vessels cannot navigate through these areas.
   However, the state in which the baselines are to be frozen is not
   answered uniformly. There seem to exist various possibilities to choose
   a ‘critical datum’, reaching from the entry into force of the UNCLOS
   over the latest charts referred to in Art. 5 UNCLOS to the point in
   which a State gives due publicity to their baselines in accordance with

   including the territorial sea and the EEZ.<a href="#fn169"

   This approach is also supported by Freestone.<a href="#fn170"

      id="fnref171" role="doc-noteref"><sup>171</sup></a> The impacts of such
   an approach are obvious: the outer limits would be divorced from the
   baseline which keeps its ambulatory character. While the territorial sea
   would increase and would become larger than the 12 nm mentioned in Art.
   3 UNCLOS, the breadth of the EEZ would stay equal compared to
   nowadays.<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>172</sup></a> This implies that the States

      id="fnref173" role="doc-noteref"><sup>173</sup></a> Furthermore, the

</p>
<h4 id="maintaining-outer-limits-of-the-eez">Maintaining outer limits of

</h4>
<p>Another option is to freeze the outer limits of the EEZ only. This
   would mean to make geographical coordinates of the EEZ at a certain
   point legally binding. Similar to the aforementioned approach, the
   baselines would stay ambulatory. In contrast, the territorial sea would
   ambulate following the baseline. Consequently, the territorial sea would
   not exceed 12 nm as stated in Art. 3 UNCLOS. What can be observed in
   this approach is, however, an increasing breadth of the EEZ, counting
   more than the 200 nm stipulated by Art. 57 UNCLOS. This essentially
   means that the sovereignty of a State (which can be exercised in the
   territorial sea) would not increase breadth-wise. Only the economic
   rights in the EEZ would increase. Accordingly, Soons concludes that this
   solution “(…) would involve the least intrusion on the current rules on
   baselines and other rules of the law of the sea.”<a href="#fn175"

</p>
<h4 id="maintaining-outer-limits-of-the-territorial-sea">Maintaining
   outer limits of the territorial sea

<p>This approach was also subject to the discussions of the
   International Law Association Committee on International Law and Sea
   Level Rise.<a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>176</sup></a> Still, this approach was only
   slightly touched and was not discussed in the full scope. Neither does

      href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>177</sup></a>. Thus, it seems to be necessary to
   evaluate the impacts of such an approach. In this approach, baselines
   would ambulate and would still be the crucial point for determining the
   outer limits of the EEZ. The territorial sea would be, in contrast to
   the EEZ, decoupled from the baseline and would not be determined by
   distance any more. Accordingly, the gained waters (as a cause of
   baselines shifting landwards) would fall into the territorial sea,
   ultimately leading to an increase of maritime territory. While the
   territorial sea would grow larger than their designated breadth of 12 nm
   according to Art. 3 UNCLOS, the breadth of the EEZ would shrink.
   Consequently, States would then lose influence further seawards. In the
   case of a shift of more than 200 nm landwards, the territorial sea would
   supercede the EEZ. In this case the part of the UNCLOS addressing the
   EEZ would become irrelevant as the territorial sea is governed by a
   separate part of the Convention. Thus, this would not be in the interest
   of States, as they essentially do not want to lose their influence
   further seawards of the current outer limits of the territorial sea.
</p>
<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>
<p>All the presented solutions above face in one or the other way
   different and various challenges and certain legal implications. First
   of all, it is worth noting that the drawers of the UNCLOS did not
   explicitly address the upcoming problem of climate change and the legal
   implications coming with it.<a href="#fn178" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref178" role="doc-noteref"><sup>178</sup></a> This said, it is not
   surprising that the UNCLOS itself is silent on that matter.<a
      href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>179</sup></a> By negative implication or rather
   an argument a contrario, it can be observed that the UNCLOS does not
   recognize any state of permanence neither for marine spaces nor for
   baselines (exceptions are the continental shelf and straight baselines)
   which would be important in order to prevent the lose of marine
   entitlements seawards. <a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref180" role="doc-noteref"><sup>180</sup></a> This clearly
   indicates that other outer limits of the maritime zones are not meant to
   be of a durable state except from the continental shelf.<a href="#fn181"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181" role="doc-noteref"><sup>181</sup></a>
   Following this, it must be concluded that none of the
   ‘freezing-solutions’ presented above, which all rely on a fixing of
   current outer limits of maritime zones, can be based on the UNCLOS and
   only fragments of regulations of the UNCLOS can be interpreted or rather
   used to find a kind of - even if only partly - solution for this
   matter.<a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>182</sup></a>
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, as according to its preamble, the UNCLOS was concluded
   in order to <em>(…)contribute to the strengthening of peace (…)</em> <a
      href="#fn183" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref183"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>183</sup></a>, the presented solutions should be
   taken into consideration in order to maintain peace between the treaty
   parties. To maintain peace, it is also important to find a global
   consistent solution to avoid several different legal responses by States
   on this matter. This becomes all the more important for the first and
   most affected States by the sea level rise as these are in the need of a
   fast solution due to the pressing time frame. Thence, it is (rightly)
   felt that a ‘Business as Usual’ approach - meaning the protection which
   is in line with the current law of the sea - of marine entitlements is
   not enough and also unfair, as the most affected States are usually not
   among the biggest contributors to climate change and sea level rise.<a
      href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>184</sup></a>
</p>
<p>To start with, all solutions of freezing share certain similarities.
   They are all characterized in one or another way by providing some kind
   of legal as well as actual stability. Consequently, States would have
   not such a big incentive any more to protect the current baseline in
   artificial ways (at least speaking of the legal determination of their
   designated zones in accordance with the UNCLOS). Thus, the financial
   burden would be minimized.<a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref185" role="doc-noteref"><sup>185</sup></a> Additionally, it
   could be argued that all freezing methods except the freezing of the
   outer limits of the territorial sea would, speaking of the range of
   influence seawards, reflect the status quo and would safeguard the
   interest of States. Also, it would prevent maritime zones of getting the
   character of the high seas. This is concomitant with a freezing of the
   high seas as well, because the furthest extend of States´ influence
   would be maintained and legally fixed. This means on the one hand, that
   the community´s interest on the high seas would be limited as the high
   seas would not increase any more; on the other hand, the community would
   not lose any existing high seas through the (artificial) increase of
   land mass.<a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>186</sup></a>
</p>
<p>However, the aforementioned similarities should not distract from the
   differences that exist between the freezing solutions. Especially the
   fate of the waters further landwards differs. The highest increase of
   full and exclusive territorial sovereignty can be observed when freezing
   the baseline. The increase is closely linked to the baseline. All waters
   landwards of the baseline fall into the territory of the coastal State.
   Thus, all the lost territory in the cause of the sea level rise would
   stay under full and exclusive sovereignty of a State. This essentially
   means, that there is for example no innocent passage<a href="#fn187"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187" role="doc-noteref"><sup>187</sup></a>
   in a huge area. Also, in the case of a complete submergence of a State
   there would be marine areas, namely the internal waters of the former
   land territory, where no passage rights for foreign vessels would
   apply.
</p>
<p>Maintaining the outer limits of the territorial sea and the EEZ would
   consequently lead to an increase of (limited) territorial sovereignty in
   the territorial sea because the territorial sea would still depend on
   the baseline which ambulates. Due to this, foreign vessels would have
   the right of innocent passage. Also, the aforementioned situation of a
   submergence of a State causing restricted areas, would not exist.
</p>
<p>Freezing the outer limits of the territorial sea would lead to an
   even bigger increase of the territorial sea (speaking breadth-wise) and
   therefore also to an increase of territorial sovereignty. At the same
   time, the outer limits of the EEZ would still depend on the baseline.
   This would lead to a strange situation, when hypothetically the outer
   limits of the EEZ would fall into the area of the increased territorial
   sea. In this theoretical case, the interests of States to keep their
   influence seawards will be minimized as they would finally only have
   influence with the range of the current outer limits of the territorial
   sea. Additionally, this increasing overlapping of these two maritime
   zones raises dogmatical concerns. As the rights of the coastal State
   within the territorial sea are more comprehensive than the ones which
   are allocated to the coastal State in the EEZ, Part V UNCLOS dedicated
   to the EEZ would lose its scope entirely or is respectively minimized
   (breadth-wise) dramatically when these zones overlap. Thus, the
   maintenance of the outer limits of the territorial sea cannot be deemed
   as appropriate to solve the problem.
</p>
<p>The least increase of territorial sovereign rights and the least
   limitation of rights of other States can be seen when maintaining the
   outer limits of the EEZ only. As the zones stipulating the sovereign
   rights to the coastal State will move landwards with the ambulatory
   baseline, the part of the economic exclusive rights of the coastal State
   will increase. With this approach States would not lose their economic
   valuable rights seawards and the States territorial rights would not
   increase. A complete submergence of a State would therefore leave only
   an economic zone behind which limits the rights of other States the
   least. Thus, it can be concluded that the freezing of the outer limits
   of the EEZ only would lead to a balance between the economic interest
   and the limitation of the increase of territorial sovereignty.
</p>
<p>Another difference between all approaches is the fate of the
   baseline. While the maintenance of the baseline means that these will
   not shift - speaking legally - any more, the other approaches would
   follow the view of the ambulatory character of baselines. In these
   approaches, baselines would follow the actual low-water line. Thence,
   freezing baselines would require to abandon the general principle
   according to which the baseline is ambulatory. Also, sometimes the
   argument is raised that the freezing of baselines would take workload of
   the shoulder of the States because they do not have to update their
   charts any more.<a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>188</sup></a> Nonetheless, this argument is
   actually unsubstantiated: in order to fulfill their designated purpose,
   charts need to be updated regularly to safeguard the navigation.<a
      href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>189</sup></a>
</p>
<p>Detached from the aforementioned discussion of the (dis-) advantages
   of each approach, all of them could be seen as contradicting the
   principle ‘land dominates the sea’. However, this argument can partially
   be invalidated for the approach of only freezing the outer limits of the
   EEZ by pointing to the following consideration: As a principle it is
   recognized that the land should dominate the sea, basically saying that
   there cannot be any claims over marine spaces where there is no land
   associated to it.<a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>190</sup></a> However, although details of this
   principle are surely under legal debate<a href="#fn191"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>191</sup></a>, there are already exceptions to
   this principle which have their base in regulations of the UNCLOS.<a
      href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>192</sup></a> An example is the permanent state
   of the legal continental shelfs once these are declared. The outer
   limits of the legal continental shelfs are fixed permanently, although
   the continental shelf does not meet the geological conditions set out in
   Art. 76 para 1 and 4 UNCLOS. Even though there is no land mass which
   dominates the sea in this regard, the permanent state of those shelfs
   seems to be (widely) accepted. <a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref193" role="doc-noteref"><sup>193</sup></a> Against this
   background, the relationship of the EEZ and the continental shelf must
   be examined closer. According to Art. 56 para 1 lit. a UNCLOS, the
   coastal States´ sovereign rights extend besides the waters superjacent
   to the seabed also on the <em>seabed and subsoil</em>. However, Art. 56
   para 3 UNCLOS stipulates that “<em>the rights set out with respect to
   the seabed and subsoil shall be exercised in accordance with Part
   VI.</em>” Part VI is designated to regulate the continental shelf. Thus,
   it can be noted that the EEZ - through the integration of Part VI of the
   UNCLOS by Art. 56 para 3 of the Convention - already knows a kind of
   permanent state speaking of the seabed and the subsoil. From this
   authors point of view, this could mean that a certain permanence of the
   EEZ is already anchored in the UNCLOS. Although this does not mean that
   this may be the legal ground for the freezing of the whole EEZ, it can
   be argued that the maintenance of the outer limits of the EEZ would fit
   in the context of the UNCLOS. As there is no similar consideration
   regarding the other outer limits of the maritime zones, the freezing of
   the outer limits of the EEZ would interfere less with the principle of
   land dominates the sea than the other proposals would do.
</p>
<p>Another problem would arise even when agreeing on the freezing of the
   outer limits of the EEZ. It stays unclear what motivation drives a State
   in order to freeze current limits. This can - in the obvious case - be
   the danger of sea level rise. Others may only act out of selfish,
   economic reasons. If a legal solution should only include States that
   are actually concerned by sea level rise, a possibility would be to
   establish another international institution, similarly to the
   institutions already provided by the UNCLOS (Seabed Authority,
   Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf). Such an institution
   could decide and evaluate if a State may or may not freeze current
   limits. However, it seems difficult to find and agree on a criterion to
   differentiate between affected and non-affected States by sea level
   rise. Furthermore, such a division might be unfair and inappropriate
   while finding a global solution to a global problem. At the same time,
   it would not make any difference to distinguish between these groups
   because when a State is not affected by sea level rise and is freezing
   its limits there will be no difference between the frozen and the actual
   outer limits of the EEZ. Also, such a procedure could endanger the goal
   in reaching a solution, as these neglected States could object to these
   rules.
</p>
<p>At first glance, an approval of all methods of freezing would at
   least be conceivable. On the one hand the extend of a marine
   entitlements in direction of the sea would be in most cases (freezing
   baselines, freezing of outer limits of the EEZ, freezing of the outer
   limits of the EEZ and outer limits of the territorial sea) equal.
   However, the fate of waters further landwards would differ. In light of
   the spatial division, this is concomitant with different applicable
   legal regimes associated with each zone. Essentially, this would lead to
   (depending on the chosen approach significant) differences - speaking of
   the spatial extend of the maritime zones - from State to State. This
   would be somewhat confusing and impractical, already imaginable for
   vessels which navigate through zones of different States. Thence, such
   an approach should be rejected.
</p>
<p>To conclude, out of the proposed freezing methods, the approach of
   maintaining only the outer limits of the EEZ seems to be the most
   conceivable option. Firstly, it would only decouple the
   baseline-dependency of one maritime boundary. At the same time, States
   would not lose their economic interests seawards while there is no
   increase of sovereign rights or even territorial sovereignty speaking
   breadth-wise. Finally, it would also be consistent with the ambulatory
   character of baselines and speaking practically, would only lead to a
   development of a new legal tool (for further discussion see following
   section) for one maritime zone. Additionally, the freezing of the outer
   limits of the EEZ seems to be already anchored in the UNCLOS through the
   permanent state of the continental shelf regime. The possible legal
   incorporation of such will be discussed in the following.
</p>
<h2 id="possible-legal-incorporation">Possible Legal Incorporation</h2>
<p>After identifying possible solutions to adopt baselines to sea level
   rise, it is necessary to examine how these solutions can potentially be
   implemented. This is especially important because none of the presented
   solutions finds a sufficiently clear legal base in the UNCLOS.
</p>
<p>The UNCLOS itself is open for new developments, thus opening the door
   for the incorporation of amendments according to Art. 312 - Art. 316
   UNCLOS.<a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>194</sup></a> Those amendments are legally
   binding for treaty parties and even for States that have not been part
   of the UNCLOS at the time of the agreement on the amendment according to
   Art. 316 para 4 and para 6 UNCLOS. Art. 312 UNCLOS stipulates the
   opportunity that “<em>(a)fter the expiry of a period of 10 years from
   the date of entry into force of this convention, a State Party may (…)
   propose specific amendments to this Convention (…)</em>”. As the UNCLOS
   is in most States in force for more than 10 years, it is possible for
   States to follow the procedure laid out in Art. 312 UNCLOS and propose
   such an amendment.<a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref195"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>195</sup></a>
</p>
<p>Although given the possibility of agreeing on amendments according to
   Art. 312 ff. UNCLOS, it is most likely that this possibility will not be
   used <a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>196</sup></a> and that the Convention will
   rather be enhanced by other international mechanisms, for instance by
   soft law (customary international law) or by new separate treaties.<a
      href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>197</sup></a>
</p>
<p>Customary international law consists of two elements; a sufficiently
   uniform <strong>State practice</strong> and an <strong>opinio
   juris</strong>.<a href="#fn198" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>198</sup></a> In order to establish new
   customary international law there is a need of both these elements.
   First of all, there needs to be a common State practice to solve the
   problem in a way presented above. A State practice must be uniform,
   sufficiently general and of a certain durability.<a href="#fn199"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>199</sup></a>
</p>
<p>At the time of writing there is not a common practice of States of
   any of these solutions yet. However, it is worth noting that the
   Taputapuãtea Declaration on Climate Change at Papeete (signed by seven
   leaders of Polynesian States and Territories in 2015) addresses this
   issue.<a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>200</sup></a> Verbatim it says in there that all
   State parties to the UNFCCC should acknowledge the “<em>permanently
   establish(ment) (of) <strong>the baselines</strong></em> (emphasis
   added) <em>in accordance with the UNCLOS, without taking into account
   sea level rise.</em>”<a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>201</sup></a> This outcome (the permanently fix
   of baselines) was also reassured by the Summit of the Parties to the
   Nauru Agreement in 2018.<a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref202" role="doc-noteref"><sup>202</sup></a> In 2016 the Republic
   of the Marshall Islands declared by the Marshall Islands Maritime Zones
   Declaration Act 2016 to “<em>repeal(…) the Marine Zones Act of 1984, and

      href="#fn203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref203"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>203</sup></a> Following this, the Republic of
   the Marshall Islands publicized another Baselines &amp; Maritime Zones
   Outer Limits Declaration in 2016. This includes a detailed depiction of
   geographic coordinates determining baselines and outer limits of
   maritime zones of the Republic of the Marshall Islands in over 450
   pages. Freestone and Schofield have concluded, that the “<em>Marshall
   Islands legislation (…) appears to anticipate that, once established,
   these ‘lines in the sea’ defining baselines, limits and boundaries will
   not move in the future.</em>”<a href="#fn204" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref204" role="doc-noteref"><sup>204</sup></a> Also, Kiribati<a
      href="#fn205" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref205"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>205</sup></a> and Tuvalu<a href="#fn206"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref206" role="doc-noteref"><sup>206</sup></a>
   have passed a similar legislation. However, the United States have
   declared an objection against the approach of the Republic of the
   Marshall Islands.<a href="#fn207" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref207"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>207</sup></a> This objection finds its reason in
   the claim of marine entitlements designated to the Wake Island which is
   in the view of the United States not under the sovereignty of the
   Republic of the Marshall Islands, but rather territory of the United
   States<a href="#fn208" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref208"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>208</sup></a> and cannot be used to establish
   marine entitlements.
</p>
<p>Even though these examples are State practice, the practice is not
   sufficiently general and uniform, not even speaking of a corresponding
   opinio juris. Thus, the observed State practice does not meet the
   requirements of a State practice in order to establish customary
   international law. Detached from the question of the establishment of
   customary law <em>in concreto</em>, such an establishment seems to have
   a huge disadvantage regarding the pressing relevance of the matter. The
   development of a common State practice and an opinio juris is formed
   over time and thus consequently takes time<a href="#fn209"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref209"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>209</sup></a>. Thus, new customary international
   law seems to be too slow and too impractical as the legal binding of the
   customary law would potentially come too late to meet the interests and
   needs of the States which are concerned by sea level rise.<a
      href="#fn210" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref210"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>210</sup></a>
</p>
<p>Hence, it seems appropriate that States agree on a new separate
   treaty on this matter on a global level.<a href="#fn211"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref211" role="doc-noteref"><sup>211</sup></a>
   It seems feasible to reach an agreement between the States of the
   UNCLOS, i.e. an Implementation Agreement like the 1994 Agreement.<a
      href="#fn212" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref212"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>212</sup></a> However, keeping the global
   character in mind, it would be desirable to include also other States in
   the process of these agreements as they are affected by the sea level
   rise as well. Thus, the United Nations<a href="#fn213"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref213" role="doc-noteref"><sup>213</sup></a>
   may be the appropriate institution to come up with a new treaty
   regarding this problem as to make one solution legally binding.<a
      href="#fn214" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref214"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>214</sup></a> However, even such an approach
   would face various challenges, first and foremost and most importantly
   an agreement of all participating States is not secured for various
   reasons.<a href="#fn215" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref215"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>215</sup></a>
</p>
<p>To sum up, there are a few ways to decide on an appropriate solution
   regarding the shifting of baselines making it legally binding. However,
   it seems unlikely that States will agree on a new amendment to the
   UNCLOS as well as the establishment of customary international law seems
   to be impractical in this matter. Thus, it is desirable to reach a
   global treaty including all States to solve this matter.
</p>
<h2 id="conclusional-remarks">Conclusional Remarks</h2>
<p>Climate change and the rise of the sea level are urgent issues,
   endangering coastlines around the world. Although predictions of the
   IPCC differ due to the scenario taken as a basis, it is clear that the
   sea level rise has a significant impact until the end of the century
   making it a pressing topic due to the relatively close time frame. Among
   the territory of the State the baselines, which serve as a base for the
   delimitation of most maritime zones, will be affected by the sea level
   rise. A crucial and decisive measure setting the way ahead is the
   question of the ambulatory character of baselines. Under the assumption
   that baselines are not - in a legal sense - ambulatory, they will not
   change compared to baselines shown on the charts at some point. Thus,
   making the legal responses in this regard obsolete. In contrast,
   provided the (preferable) ambulatory character of baselines, they will
   essentially shift landwards as they are the actual low-water line. Such
   a shifting is concomitant among other disadvantages with a loss of
   territory and further seawards with a loss of certain rights. Thus, the
   interest of many States is to keep (at least) the current state of
   influence in accordance with the UNCLOS.
</p>
<p>Against this background, this matter has been subject of legal
   discussion, especially in the last two decades as this matter has become
   more and more apparent and pressing. Thence, possible solutions for this
   matter have been raised. In view of the legal regulations of the UNCLOS,
   it must be emphasized that there indeed do exist certain methods or
   rather mechanisms in order to face the challenge of sea level rise,
   namely the maintaining of the current baselines, the greater usage of
   straight baselines or the declaration of the continental shelf. However,
   these often do not fulfill the interests of States in toto. Thence,
   methods of freezing of maritime boundaries and the baselines have been
   proposed. It is worth noting that none of these freezing-solutions does
   have a fundamental character in the wording of the UNCLOS.
</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it seems reasonable to find a solution as the most
   affected States are usually not among the biggest contributors to
   climate change. Out of the solutions presented above, the maintaining or
   rather the freezing of the outer limits of the EEZ would be a reasonable
   solution as it still provides the States concerned with rights in their
   former areas while not extending their territorial sovereignty in the
   internal waters in the direction of the sea. Moreover, the relationship
   of the continental shelf regime and the EEZ regime indicates that the
   EEZ does know a state of permanence, namely the outer limits of the
   seabed and subsoil. Thus, fixing the outer limits of the EEZ finds an
   anchor in the provision already. In light of this, it can also be argued
   that the maintenance of the outer limits of the EEZ contradicts the
   principle of “Land dominates the Sea” the least as this breach is
   already constituted by the integration of the continental shelf regime
   in the EEZ regime. Additionally, this would be compatible with the
   preferable ambulatory character of baselines. Thence, this solution
   stays closer to the current legal framework than the other proposals
   do.
</p>
<p>Still, it must be stressed that there is a need of legal
   incorporation of such a solution. There exist a few ways to achieve
   this. However, it seems unlikely that States make use of amendments to
   the Convention. Although a certain fragmented State practice can be
   identified in this matter, this cannot be regarded as customary
   international law yet. Therefore, the author highly suggests a separate
   treaty which would be negotiated by States concerned. This would lead to
   a (hopefully) fair, legally binding and most importantly global solution
   which is highly desirable in this matter.

            certain practice can be regarded as international customary law;
